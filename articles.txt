When The Planetary Society advocates for a balanced portfolio of planetary exploration missions at NASA, we frequently mention the importance ofcompetedmissions as part of that balance. In essence, NASA releases funding opportunities every few years for new planetary missions, and various scientific teams submit ideas to compete for that mission funding; hence the moniker, competed missions. Within NASA’s robotic planetary exploration program, there are two types of competed mission classes: Discovery and New Frontiers. Missions of these types are distinguished by their leadership structure — with a single scientist in charge of delivering the spacecraft — and the competitive process by which the project is chosen.
Competed missions historically cost less and fly more frequently than NASA’s high-profile flagship missions, which generally cost upwards of $2 billion and fly once per decade. NASA attempts to fly five Discovery-class missions and two New Frontiers missions every decade (congressional budgets permitting), with a $500 million cost cap on Discovery and a $900 million cost cap on New Frontiers. These cost caps are designed to limit NASA’s exposure to cost overruns, enabling more missions and allowing for more novel, higher-risk designs. Also distinct is the political authority granted to NASA to pursue competed missions. Flagship missions represent the agency’s top scientific priorities, are assigned to a primary NASA center for implementation, and then must secure a funding commitment from the White House’s budgeting office and obtain a “new start” approval by Congress. Only then can NASA begin making long-term contracts and commitments necessary to build a large and complex spacecraft. In contrast, Discovery and New Frontiers missions are pre-authorized by Congress; NASA can select missions within those classes as frequently as funding allows. In theory, this provides more rapid development opportunities. Competed planetary missions are science-focused and scientist-led. This is again distinct from flagship-class missions, which, while science-focused, are led by an existing NASA center. Competed missions are led by Principal Investigators (PIs) who assemble both a science and engineering team to submit a detailed proposal to the space agency for the type of mission they’d like to pursue. The scientific payload and team are proposed wholistically by the very individuals who will then implement the mission. This elevates scientific leadership to the top of the decision-making process and generally leads to a more copacetic (albeit smaller) science team.
The planetary sciencedecadal surveyprovides guidelines for the launch rates of competed missions and for science investigations for the more expensive New Frontiers missions. Discovery missions consider any high-priority scientific question within the Solar System. The lower costs, higher flight rate, and empowered scientific management of competed missions provide value back to NASA, the scientific community, and the public. They provide opportunities for scientists to assemble and manage tightly focused investigations and to gain a better understanding of the spacecraft development process. Delays and overruns are less serious than similar problems in flagship missions due to the smaller overall project budget, protecting the space agency’s other projects and the taxpayer. It also enables a more dynamic, responsive space agency that can marshal new missions to address new discoveries or scout out new locations in advance of larger missions in the future.

Examples of Discovery missions are MESSENGER, Mars Pathfinder, andPsyche; New Frontiers missions of note areJuno, OSIRIS-REx, and New Horizons. Flagship missions are much larger, such as thePerseverancerover andEuropa Clipper. By ensuring a regular cadence of competed missions, NASA supports an independent scientific community, novel approaches to scientific exploration, and a broader swath of the aerospace industry and workforce by ensuring regular work to build and maintain expertise.

Title: How to see the nova (ânew starâ) in Corona Borealis

Detailed Text:
Asa Stahl•May 29, 2024
Sometime between now and the end of the year, a giant stellar explosion is likely going to shine in the night sky. This blast, called a nova, is expected to be so bright that it will be visible even from major cities. The explosion won’t pose any danger to Earth — it’s too far away — but over a span of just days, the nova will unleash tens of thousands of times more energy than the Sun puts out over an entire year. The outburst will come from the star system T Corona Borealis, which puts on a similar show every 80 years or so. Astronomers currently predict about a 70% chance that T Corona Borealis will go nova by September, and a 95% chance that it’ll go off by the end of the year. The nova will likely be the brightest one seen on Earth since 1975. A nova is a runaway thermonuclear explosion that is, in essence, not too different from a gigantic hydrogen bomb. But instead of blasting out of a metal shell, a nova’s explosion happens on the surface of a white dwarf star.
White dwarfs are the smoldering remains of stars like the Sun. Right now, the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun’s core produces energy that pushes back against gravity and keeps the Sun from falling in on itself. Eventually, though, the Sun will run out of fuel for fusion and collapse until it’s about the size of Earth. At that point, the Sun won’t be able to get any denser without forcing its electrons past a limit set by quantum mechanics. When a star enters this stable, ultra-dense phase, it becomes a white dwarf. On its own, a white dwarf won’t make a nova. It has to be in a binary system, meaning it and another star orbit one another. If the other star still has plenty of hydrogen, and if it is not too far from the white dwarf, then the white dwarf’s gravity will skim off some of the other star’s outer layers. Over time, this fuel can accumulate on the surface of the white dwarf and heat up. When the fuel gets hot enough, it will ignite in a rapid chain reaction, releasing a giant burst of radiation and throwing off ejecta at thousands of kilometers per hour. Though this explosion is very energetic, it doesn’t destroy either star. The same pattern of build-up and burst can repeat again and again. T Corona Borealis, in particular, repeats its nova cycle roughly every 80 years. The system consists of a white dwarf and a red giant star located about 800 light-years from Earth. A supernova is a much bigger stellar explosion that does not happen more than once to the same star. Some supernovae are triggered when a star runs out of fuel for nuclear fusion and collapses, while others are caused by white dwarfs that accumulate enough mass. Regardless of the exact path, the source of a supernova has to be so massive that its gravity overcomes the quantum mechanical pressure that would keep a white dwarf stable. And while a nova leaves its star system intact, a supernova results in a neutron star or black hole, or completely destroys whatever object triggered it. Supernovae are also rarer than novae. The last supernova to happen in the Milky Way was in 1604, while the last nova was in 2022, though it was too dim to see with the naked eye.
Some novae repeat relatively often, once every hundred years or more. If people observed these “recurrent novae” when they happened in the past, scientists can compare how light from the system changed in the lead-up to each outburst and look for similar behavior today. People have recorded novae from T Corona Borealis four times in the past. In 1217, an abbot in Germany wrote about it as a “wonderful sign.” In 1787, the nova was spotted again by an English astronomer. And in 1866 and 1946, scientists around the world took detailed measurements of how the system’s brightness changed over time. In 2015, astronomers noticed that T Corona Borealis was entering the same sort of phase that preceded its 1946 outburst by eight years. They initially predicted the system would erupt in the mid-2020s. Over time, researchers have narrowed the timing down to about a 70% chance of an outburst by September 2024 and a 95% chance of it by the end of the year. When it goes nova, T Corona Borealis should be visible to the naked eye at night from even relatively bright skies, like those in the middle of urban areas. It will dim significantly within days, though, so the best time to try to spot it will be as soon as the news breaks.
At that point, the nova will be about as bright as Polaris, the north star, which is among the top 50 brightest stars in the entire night sky. As the nova dims to the point where it’s no longer possible to see with the unaided eye, it may still be possible to view through binoculars or other special equipment. The nova will appear in the constellation Corona Borealis, or “northern crown,” which is located between the Hercules and Boötes constellations. This part of the sky should be visible from most places on Earth except for the far south, close to Antarctica. The nova won’t look like an explosion, but like a new star that wasn’t there before. So, to fully appreciate this celestial event, it’s worth looking up and noting that you can’t see the system before it goes nova.

Title: Earthâs quasi-moons, minimoons, and ghost moons
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/the-quasi-moons-of-earth
Detailed Text:
Asa Stahl•May 21, 2024
Earth hosts seven known quasi-moons, an unknown number of minimoons, and maybe, sometimes, two ghost moons. Though none of these pseudo-moons are as big or influential as Earth’s one true natural satellite —the Moon— they are still valuable for science and exploration. Quasi- and minimoons offer promising targets for future space missions, a window into our planet’s neighborhood, and a sampling of the sort of asteroids that could potentially hit Earth. Earth’s quasi-moons get their name because, from a certain vantage point, they appear to act like moons. But from a wider perspective, it becomes obvious that they aren’t actually moons at all — they’reasteroids. It’s like a gravitational sleight of hand. From our point of view onEarth, each of these asteroids looks like it is orbiting our planet, yet they actually orbit the Sun. In fact, the quasi-moons of Earth essentially share its orbit. They follow almost the exact same path as we do around the Sun.
As these asteroids trace their orbits, they are slightly affected by Earth’s gravity, too. They don’t circle Earth like satellites, but their orbits do fall into a kind of lockstep with our planet that keeps them close by. A quasi-moon sometimes drifts ahead of Earth and sometimes trails behind it as both go around the Sun. From our vantage point, it ends up looking like the quasi-moon is orbiting us instead of our star. This configuration is called quasi-satellite motion, and it is one of several ways that celestial bodies can share an orbit with Earth. There are also “trojan” orbits, where an object traces loops around a point that stays consistently  ahead of or behind Earth as it goes around the Sun. And there are “horseshoe” orbits, where an object switches between leading Earth in its orbit and trailing it, but does not stay close to Earth like in quasi-satellite motion. All of Earth’s known quasi-moons are temporary. After hundreds or thousands of years, most will transition to trojan or horseshoe orbits. At the same time, some asteroids that are currently in one of these other kinds of shared orbits will eventually transition to become quasi-moons. A minimoon is an object that truly orbits a world, but only temporarily. Earth’s minimoons last for less than a year on average. They are very small and hard to detect: only four minimoons of Earth have ever been discovered, and none are still orbiting Earth. Some may actually have beenspace debris. The Gaia spacecraft was once mistaken for a minimoon, and so were rocket stages from the Chang’e 2 and Lunar Prospector missions.
Ghost moons — if they really exist — are swirling clouds of dust that share Earth’s orbit, staying ahead of or behind Earth as it goes around the Sun. Officially called “Kordylewski clouds,” ghost moons were first reported in the 1960s and were only tentatively confirmed in 2018. There is still no broad consensus on whether these clouds exist. It’s possible they appear and disappear depending on the influence of the Sun and planets. Quasi-moons can orbit other planets, moons, or even asteroids. Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Pluto, and the asteroid Ceres all host at least one known quasi-moon. The first quasi-moon ever discovered,Zoozve, goes around Venus. Itgained its unusual namein a quirk of history, when an artist misread its original identifier 2002 VE68.
Scientists used to think certain quasi-moons had a significant chance of impacting Earth, but thankfully, that’s no longer the case. Since Earth’s current quasi-moons are around 10–300 meters (30–1000 feet) in size, some are large enough to cause massive damage to a regionif they were to hit us. But there is no risk of a known quasi-moon colliding with Earth in the foreseeable future. The orbits of quasi-moons are predictable enough that astronomers should be able to see an impact coming well before it happens. As for minimoons, it’s not rare for them to hit Earth. About 1% of all minimoons eventually do, but most are small, so they burn up in our planet’s atmosphere. A very dangerously large minimoon, say 1 kilometer (0.6 mi) in diameter, is expected to hit Earth once every billion years at most. Quasi-moons and minimoons are pieces of our neighborhood in space, and they carry information about where they come from. They might originate in the main asteroid belt, from impacts on the Moon, or from the break-up of larger objects on similar orbits — scientists don’t know for sure. Answering that question, and finding out what these almost-moons are made of, can help researchers learn more about asteroids andhow they threaten Earth. Since quasi-moons orbit close to Earth and are often quite small, they would also be easier to visit and redirect than most other asteroids. This makes them ideal targets for missions like China’sTianwen-2. Scheduled for launch in 2025, Tianwen-2 will visit the quasi-moon 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, collect samples, and explode part of the asteroid’s surface to see what lies beneath. In the future, quasi-moons around other worlds could even act as science platforms, offering a vantage point for monitoring whatever body they loop around.

Title: What is the Outer Space Treaty?
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/what-is-the-outer-space-treaty
Detailed Text:
Kate Howells•May 14, 2024
The Outer Space Treaty is an international agreement that governs how nations act in space. Formally known as the "Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies," it is one of international space law’s foundational documents. The overall purpose of theOuter Space Treatyis to keep space peaceful. Key provisions include banning nuclear weapons in space, preventing any country from claiming sovereignty over any celestial body, and establishing that space is to be freely explored and used by all nations for peaceful purposes. The Outer Space Treaty was motivated by concerns over the use of nuclear weapons in space. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States competed to develop powerful rockets and nuclear weapons, going so far as to test nuclear weapons in space. In response to this arms race, the United Nations began debating proposals for an arms control treaty governing outer space, which led to the development of the Outer Space Treaty. The treaty was adopted by the United Nations in 1967. Its first signatories were the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. As of 2024,115 countriesare parties to the treaty, including all major spacefaring nations. Another 22 countries are signatories.
The Outer Space Treaty includes several important principles that guide space exploration and use to this day. According to theU.N. Office of Outer Space Affairs, the treaty’s key principles are: That the exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind; That outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all states; That outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means; That states shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies or station them in outer space in any other manner; That the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes; prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications That astronauts shall be regarded as the envoys of mankind; That states shall be responsible for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities; That states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects; and That states shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies. Space activities have evolved enormously since 1967. Still, like many foundational documents, the Outer Space Treaty continues to guide the way international space law addresses new challenges, such as the growth of commercial space activities, interest in mining celestial bodies, removing orbital debris, and more. Several other treaties and agreements have built on the foundations laid by the Outer Space Treaty to address specific aspects of space activities and provide additional legal frameworks for outer space governance. The Rescue Agreement(1968) details states’ obligations to assist astronauts in distress and to return them to their country of origin. It also requires states to return parts of spacecraft found within their territory to the launching country. The Liability Convention(1972) elaborates on the mechanisms for damage compensation that states are liable for if their space activities cause harm to other states or their properties, whether in space or on Earth. The Registration Convention(1975) requires states to provide the United Nations with a registry of objects launched into outer space, to help manage space traffic and mitigate space debris. The Moon Agreement(1984) elaborates on the Outer Space Treaty’s principles regarding the Moon, specifically declaring that the Moon and its natural resources are the common heritage of mankind and can’t be exploited by any individual state or company for profit. However, the Moon Agreement has been ratified by relatively few countries and lacks participation from all major space-faring nations. The Artemis Accords(2020): Unlike the above agreements, the Artemis Accords are not affiliated with the United Nations. Instead, they were developed by the United States in conjunction with NASA’sArtemis Program. The Artemis Accords are designed to serve as practical and modern principles to guide cooperation in space exploration. As of May 2024, 39 countries have signed the Artemis Accords.

Title: Meet the Habitable Worlds Observatory, NASAâs life-seeking telescope
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/meet-habitable-worlds-observatory
Detailed Text:
Jason Davis•May 06, 2024
A powerful new space telescope could help us answer the question of whether or not we are alone in the Universe. NASA’s Habitable Worlds Observatory, or HWO, is a “Super Hubble” telescope that would directly image Earth-sizeexoplanetscircling other stars. Using a JWST-size mirror and ultra-precise optics, HWO would scrutinize the atmospheres of these worlds for signs of life. “It's the first observatory really designed around characterizing exoplanets as complex worlds, and not just as discovering them as point sources,” said Giada Arney, a member of the Science, Technology, and Architecture Review Team for HWO at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “That's really exciting for me as a planetary scientist.” More than just a life hunter, HWO is designed to be a multipurpose observatory like Hubble and JWST. The telescope will study what drives galaxy growth and trace the origins of elements and molecules in the early Universe. It would also monitor worlds much closer to home. “I'm excited about the possibility of observing our Solar System's ocean worlds, such as Neptune's moonTritonand Jupiter's moonEuropa,” said Lynnae Quick, an ocean worlds planetary scientist at Goddard. “HWO could be instrumental in helping us learn more about volatile cycling on Triton as the seasons change there,” she said. Building a next-generation observatory to hunt for life and advance our understanding of the Cosmos will be a challenging and costly project. The telescope would not launch until at least the early 2040s. But it will be worth the wait.
No one knows what HWO will look like, as the telescope is still in its early design stages. But some basic requirements are already in place, thanks to the2020 astrophysics decadal survey, a community-authored report that sets priorities for NASA’s next 10 years. HWO would have a mirror about the size ofJWST’s and be positioned at the same location: the second Lagrange point, a gravitationally stable spot located 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Earth. LikeHubble, HWO would be serviceable, meaning future astronauts could journey to the telescope for repairs and upgrades. Also like Hubble, HWO would gather light in shorter, visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, where certain biosignatures are more pronounced. Shorter wavelengths also work best with a key piece of technology needed to directly observe exoplanets: a coronagraph. Coronagraphs are used to block the light of stars, revealing fainter nearby objects. Imaging an exoplanet is like searching for a firefly next to a spotlight. Seeing smaller, Earth-size planets will require the most advanced coronagraph ever built. “We need a coronagraph that is thousands of times more capable than any prior space coronagraph,” said Arney. “We also need an optics system that is exquisitely stable.” A technology demonstration coronagraph for HWO will fly on the upcomingRoman Space Telescope. Rather than blocking a star’s light with a disc,Roman’s coronagraphuses a series of mirrors and masks to separate light from an exoplanet from that of its host star. The mirrors are so precise that they can make adjustments smaller than the width of a strand of DNA. As extraordinary as that sounds, the requirements for the optics within HWO’s coronagraph may be even stricter, requiring corrections on the order of tens of picometers, smaller than the width of an atom.
HWO will examine the atmospheres of at least 25 potentially habitable worlds, searching for biosignatures that could indicate the presence of life. The detection of biosignatures requires context, so that we can avoid being fooled by non-life processes. Key Earth biosignatures sought by HWO will include oxygen, ozone, and methane, though others are also under consideration. Scientists will have to apply what they know about the planets and moons in our own Solar System to interpret the conditions on the exoplanets HWO observes. “That type of ‘ground truth’ is very important when we're looking for life,” Quick said. “In order to understand how prospects for life on Earth-like exoplanets may be affected by geological processes at their surfaces, we must first understand how geological processes on Earth and potentially habitable bodies in our Solar System, such as Europa,Mars, andTitan, have affected their suitability to harbor life over time.” Conceptual work on HWO is proceeding through two teams: START (Science, Technology, Architecture Review Team), which is working on the telescope’s science objectives, and TAG (Technical Assessment Group), which is working on technical requirements. In official NASA parlance, the project is in its pre-formulation phase. A project office at NASA Headquarters is expected to be established this year, which will move HWO into a “pre-phase A” status. It will take years to mature the technologies needed to build HWO and get the telescope ready for launch. But one day in the not-so-distant future, the observatory could train its eyes on a star system not unlike our own, and pick out the first signs of life on another world.

Title: What is the difference between astronomy and astrology?
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/what-is-the-difference-between-astronomy-and-astrology
Detailed Text:
Kate Howells•May 01, 2024
The terms “astronomy” and “astrology” are sometimes mixed up, but they actually mean very different things. While they both deal with planets and other celestial objects, astronomy is a scientific discipline, whereas astrology is a divinatory belief system. Astronomy is the field of science that studies objects and phenomena in space. Astronomers apply physics, mathematics, and chemistry to explain the origins and behaviors of planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and other celestial bodies, as well as the Universe as a whole. Astrology, on the other hand, is a divinatory practice based on the belief that the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies — particularly the Moon, Sun, and planets of the Solar System — can influence people and events. Although astrology involves real celestial objects, constellations of stars that can be seen in the night sky, and known phenomena such asapparent retrograde motion, astrology has no scientific basis and is considered a pseudoscience.
One reason why astronomy and astrology can sometimes be confused is that they are similar words. Both stem from the Greek word “astron" (ἄστρον), which means "star." The word “astronomy” combines “astron” with "nomos" (νόμος), the Greek word for "law" or "culture." The word “astrology” combines "astron" and "logia" (λογία) meaning "study of" or "discourse." Both words describe the effort to understand the stars, but each field does so in its own way. The similar etymological origins of astronomy and astrology hint at the two fields’ shared ancient roots. In ancient Babylonian, Greek, Chinese, Mayan, and other cultures, civilizations began observing the stars for both practical purposes (like navigation and agriculture) and spiritual or divinatory functions. Astrology and astronomy were one single discipline for hundreds of years. In medieval Europe, for example, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition that many educated individuals studied alongside astronomy. However, astronomy and astrology increasingly diverged as scientific methodologies developed during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Better tools and theoretical frameworks allowed astronomers to observe and understand the Cosmos, developing and proving theories about the physical Universe through empirical study. Astrology progressed along a different, more metaphysical path, and its lack of empirical support defined it as a pseudoscience, aligning more with personal belief systems than with natural science.
Three thousand years ago, the Babylonians observed that from Earth’s perspective, the Sun appears to move through 12 of the charted constellations over the course of a year. This led to the development of the signs of the zodiac, a foundational part of astrology today. But astronomers have pointed out in recent years that the Babylonians’ observations were not completely accurate, and that the 12 zodiac signs have become even less accurate over time. The biggest inaccuracy is the number 12, since the Sunactually moves through 13 constellationsin a year, including Ophiuchus. The zodiac calendar was also simplified, with each of the 12 constellations arbitrarily assigned a full month, although the Sun’s path is not that evenly divided. And third, because the Earth wobbles on its axis, the Sun’s apparent path through the stars today is different from the path it would have taken 3,000 years ago when the zodiac was devised. This difference actually results in aone-month shiftin the stars' alignments. Because astrology is not a science, these inaccuracies have not widely affected how people practice it. Although some astrologically-inclined people who used to identify as Sagittarius might now call themselves Ophiuchus, the field as a whole has not adapted to this new information. Astrology has changed in response to other, less threatening, advances in astronomy. For example, the dwarf planet Pluto became incorporated into astrological models after it was discovered in 1930. This pick-and-choose reaction to new information is what differentiates pseudosciences like astrology from sciences like astronomy.

Title: Science on the docket: The 2024 Congressional Day of Action
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/science-on-the-docket-the-2024-congressional-day-of-action
Detailed Text:
On Monday, April 29, 2024, nearly 100 space advocates gathered in Washington, D.C., as part of the annualDay of Action. These advocates traveled from across the United States to push for more funding and better support for the nation’s pioneering space science program.
This year was a little different from previous Days of Action. Recently, Congress passed a budget for Fiscal Year 2024 (funding through Sept. 30, 2024) that cut NASA Science for the first time in a decade. This cut comes after five years of stagnant budgets that have not kept pace with inflation, leading to a $1 billion deficit from the agency’s peak funding year in 2020. In addition, the President’s Budget Request for FY 2025 (starting Oct. 1, 2024) includes a slight increase, butis insufficientto allow the agency to make significant progress on its ambitious space program. The requested budget also proposes the delay and cancellation of various space science missions that are part of the roadmap laid out by the Decadal Surveys. But this situation didn’t dampen spirits; in fact, it energized this year’s space advocates to new levels. And the timing couldn’t have been better. Last week, a bipartisan group of legislators, led by Representative Glenn Ivey (D-Maryland) andPlanetary Science CaucusCo-Chairs Judy Chu (D-California) and Don Bacon (R-Nebraska), began circulating a letter requesting a funding level of $9 billion for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in line with the advocacy goals of The Planetary Society. The Space Policy & Advocacy team sprung into action to update the strategy for the Day of Action to advocate for the letter. In addition to the in-person meetings, an online action was created to enable advocates from around the country to encourage their legislators to sign onto this historic letter. In response, 675 advocates from 49 states and the District of Columbia took action to send letters to their legislators in support of the Day of Action. We are happy to report that the letter was signed by 44 Members of Congress, 10% of the House of Representatives. Signers represent 16 states from across the country, from Maryland to California, New Hampshire to Arizona, and everywhere in between. The full text of the letter is availablehere, and the list of signatories is shown at the end of this article.
This funding level requested in the bipartisan letter will allow the NASA Science Mission Directorate to support its program of existing and next-generation space missions. By funding NASA SMD at $9 billion, Congress will enable: Increased support for technology development for the next Great Observatory, the Habitable Worlds Observatory; Sufficient funding for NASA to move expeditiously on a new path forward for Mars Sample Return; Restoration of funding for the Chandra and Hubble space telescopes; Full support for the Dragonfly mission to Titan as it reaches a critical stage in its development; Keeping NEO Surveyor on track to be the next dedicated space-based telescope to hunt for near-Earth objects; Adequate funding to advance the DAVINCI and VERITAS missions, facilitating the investigation of Venus’ atmosphere and surface in the early 2030s; Restored funding for other priorities for the Planetary Science, Astrophysics, Heliophysics, Earth Science, and Biological & Physical Science communities. Joining in on the Day of Action were Planetary Society CEO Bill Nye, Board President Dr. Bethany Ehlmann, Board Members Dr. Jim Bell and Dr. Britney Schmidt, and Space for Humanity Executive Director Antonio Peronace. This group met with Members of Congress to discuss our priorities, current topics in space policy, and the urgency of supporting a balanced, forward-looking portfolio for NASA Science. These meetings included high-ranking members of both parties and leadership of relevant committees. The common thread through all of these meetings was that NASA is the best brand that the United States has. The agency’s science priorities capture the imaginations of people around the world and have strong support in Congress. The Day of Action and grassroots advocacy is making a difference. As the space science community reels from recent budget cuts that have cost hundreds of jobs at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and industry partners across the country, space advocates showed up to demonstrate the broad support for NASA’s science programs. And as demonstrated by the level of support for the bipartisan letter, space unites people across political, ideological, and demographic backgrounds under a common purpose. We hope to see you in D.C. next year. The following members of Congress signed the letterled by Representatives Don Bacon (R-Nebraska), Judy Chu (D-California), and Glenn Ivey (D-Maryland)requesting a funding level of $9 billion for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in line with the advocacy goals of The Planetary Society:  Name Party State Don Bacon* R Nebraska Ami Bera D California Jamaal Bowman D New York Julia Brownley D California Salud Carbajal D California Judy Chu* D California Jason Crow D Colorado Mark DeSaulnier D California Debbie Dingell D Michigan Brian Fitzpatrick R Pennsylvania Bill Foster D Illinois Raúl Grijalva D Arizona Jahana Hayes D Connecticut Chrissy Houlahan D Pennsylvania Jared Huffman D California Glenn Ivey* D Maryland Jonathan Jackson D Illinois William Keating D Massachusetts Jen Kiggans R Virginia Raja Krishnamoorthi D Illinois Summer Lee D Pennsylvania Mike Levin D California Ted Lieu D California Stephen Lynch D Massachusetts Seth Magaziner D Rhode Island Jennifer McClellan D Virginia James McGovern D Massachusetts Seth Moulton D Massachusetts Kevin Mullin D California Grace Napolitano D California Richard Neal D Massachusetts Ilhan Omar D Minnesota Chris Pappas D New Hampshire Scott Peters D California Brittany Pettersen D Colorado Katie Porter D California Linda Sánchez D California John Sarbanes D Maryland Mary Gay Scanlon D Pennsylvania Adam Schiff D California Bobby Scott D Virginia Adam Smith D Washington Abigail Davis Spanberger D Virginia Paul Tonko D New York

China is preparing to launch a historic mission to return the first samples from the far side of the Moon. Chang’e-6(嫦娥六号) is set to blast off on May 3 aboard a Long March 5 rocket from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan Island. The spacecraft will embark on a 53-day journey to the far side of the Moon and back, returning lunar soil and rocks to Earth that will help us understand the Moon’s history. The mission will target the Moon’s South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where an ancient impact may have blasted part of the Moon’s mantle up to the surface. The region has long been thought of as a keystone to understanding how and when massive objects pelted the Moon and Earth billions of years ago, and why the far side of the Moon is sodifferent from the near side. Many missions have returned samples of the Moon to Earth over the years, most recentlyChang’e-5in 2020. But all have been from the near side, where line-of-sight communications with Earth simplify operations. Landing on the far side requires a communications relay satellite, of which China now hastwo. The country made the first successful lunar far-side landing in 2019 with Chang’e-4, and will follow that achievement with a sample return.
The Chang’e-6 spacecraft consists of four separatecomponents: an orbiter, lander, ascender, and reentry module. After launch, Chang’e-6 will travel to the Moon and enter lunar orbit. The spacecraft’s lander and ascender will travel to the surface, while the orbiter and reentry module stay in orbit. The lander and ascender will touch down in the southern part of Apollo crater, within the SPA basin. They will collect 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of lunar material using a drill and scoop. The ascender will then blast back into lunar orbit and transfer the samples to the reentry module. The orbiter will carry the service module back to Earth and release it into the atmosphere, where it will parachute to a soft landing. The entire mission is expected to last 53 days, much longer thanChang’e-5’s 23-day nearside sample return mission. While it is on the Moon’s far side, Chang’e-6 will communicate with Earth through theQueqiao-2relay satellite, which launched in March 2024. Queqiao-2 is equipped with one of the largest parabolic antennas ever sent beyond Earth, with a diameter of 4.2 meters (13.8 feet). The samples Chang’e-6 returns to Earth willprovide new insightsinto a messy period of Solar System history. Most of the Moon’s impact basins formed about3.9 billionyears ago when large objects smashed into the Moon during an event known as theLate Heavy Bombardment, or lunar cataclysm. What caused such a large number of impacts to occur at roughly the same time? There aretwo main theories. The first is that the orbits of the giant planets shifted, flinging leftover planet-forming materials toward the inner planets, producing a spike in impacts. The second theory is that the Late Heavy Bombardment was not a spike at all. Instead, it may represent the end of a longer period of gradually declining impacts. We can test these theories with samples from the SPA basin, which dominates the far side of the Moon. The basin is about4.26 billionyears old, predating the near-side impact basins. Was the SPA formed as part of the Late Heavy Bombardment? Or was it a separate event? By obtaining precise dates for the basin and the craters overlying it, we will be able to better understand the Moon’s history. This also has implications for understanding the origins of life on Earth. It’s possible that asteroidscarriedwater and organic materials to Earth during the Late Heavy Bombardment. Understanding the timing and circumstances of this event is critical for unpacking our origin story.
Beyond the tools that will help it collect samples for return to Earth, Chang’e-6 will carry two international payloads to study the way the lunar surface interacts with its tenuous atmosphere. The French-provided Detection of Outgassing RadoN (DORN) instrument will watch for radon outgassing from the Moon’s crust, while Sweden’s Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) experiment will detect negative ions emitted from the lunar surface as a result of the solar wind. Chang’e-6 will also carry Italy’s INstrument for landing-Roving laser Retroreflector Investigations (INRRI). The retroreflector will be used to precisely measure distances from orbit. Finally, a student-built Pakistani CubeSat namedICUBE-Qwill separate from Chang’e-6 into lunar orbit and take images of the orbiter, the Moon, and the Earth. It will also measure the Moon’s magnetic field. Chang’e-6 is just one part of China’s comprehensive plan for the Moon, which includeslandinghumans on the surface by 2030. The country is also planning the International Lunar Research Base (ILRS), which can be seen as a competitor to NASA’s Artemis program. Following Chang’e-6, China plans to sendChang’e-7to Shackleton Crater at the lunar south pole. Shackleton is also a candidate site for Artemis III, NASA’s first crewed moon landing since 1972. Chang’e-7 would include a rover and a small flying probe. Chang’e-8would also target the south pole and experiment with in-situ resource utilization. The mission would melt lunar soil to produce bricks that robots could use to assemble structures. Another experiment would test the viability of using plants and microbes for life support.

Title: What are planets made of?

Kate Howells•Apr 25, 2024
The planets in our Solar System are spectacularly diverse, fromEarth’socean-covered surface to mightyJupiter’sswirling storms andNeptune’smysterious blue hues. Some planets are more similar than others, and share common structures. When you look at what planets are made of, you get three main groups: terrestrial planets, gas giants, and ice giants. Our Solar System’s terrestrial planets areMercury,Venus, Earth, andMars. The word “terrestrial” comes from the Latin “terra,” which means Earth. Terrestrial planets are primarily made of rocky material and have solid surfaces. Their main layers are the core, mantle, crust, and atmosphere.
Terrestrial planets in our Solar System have cores made mostly of iron, often with a mixture of nickel and sulfur. Earth has a molten outer core that creates a magnetic field. Mars, which was once much more Earth-like,lost its internally driven magnetic field3 to 4 billion years ago when its core solidified. Between the core and the crust, terrestrial planets have a mantle made of silicate minerals containing iron and magnesium. The mantle is viscous in some cases, allowing it to flow under the crust and create tectonic and volcanic activity. The terrestrial planets differ in how much of that activity continues today. Earth still has earthquakes and volcanic eruptions today, whereas Venus, Mars, and Mercury areless active. The outermost layer of terrestrial planets is a hard crust made of lighter silicates like basalt and granite. On Earth, the crust may lie underwater or beneath soil, sand, or other loose material. On other terrestrial planets, this loose outer material is called regolith.
The terrestrial planets all have at least some atmosphere except Mercury, which only has a much thinner exosphere. Mars’ atmosphere is very thin, made mostly of carbon dioxide. Earth’s is rich in nitrogen and oxygen, helping life thrive. Venus’ thick carbon dioxide atmosphere is responsible for the planet’s greenhouse effect and searing temperatures. Jupiter andSaturnare the Solar System’s gas giants. They are both made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with smaller amounts of other gases and ices. Their main layers are the core, a deep atmosphere, and an outer atmosphere.
Both Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have small, rocky and metallic cores surrounded by layers of metallic hydrogen, which might be mixed with rockier material. NASA’sJuno spacecraftis currently in orbit around Jupiter, attempting to understand what’s happening deep inside the planet, among other things. Although Juno can’t observe Jupiter’s core directly, the spacecraft has provided scientists with evidence that the planet’s core islargerand “fuzzier” than previously thought. Researchers nowhypothesizeJupiter has a diluted core rather than a solid, compact center. Surrounding the core, gas giants have a layer of atmosphere made primarily of hydrogen and helium. Because this deep atmosphere has so much gas above it, the pressure and temperature are so high that hydrogen becomes metallic and electrically conductive. The visible outer layers of Jupiter and Saturn are made of hydrogen and helium, along with ammonia, methane, water vapor, and other compounds that form clouds and storm systems.
Uranusand Neptune are known as ice giants. This name comes from the fact that both planets are mostly made of things that form ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane. Although the ice giants have not been studied as extensively as the gas giants or terrestrial planets, we still have an idea of what their cores, mantles, and atmospheres are made of.
Ice giants likely have cores of rock and metal similar to those of the gas giants. Beyond that lie oceans of water, ammonia, and methane, squeezed by intense pressures into semi-solid states. Electric currents flowing through their icy-hot oceans may be responsible for powering the ice giants’ magnetic fields. Like Jupiter and Saturn, the ice giants’ atmospheres consist mostly of hydrogen and helium, with the addition of water and ammonia as well as methane that absorbs red light, giving them theirdeep blue hues. The only actual ices in ice giants are found in clouds in their upper atmospheres. When it comes to composition, planets outside our Solar System may follow the same general groupings as our home planets.Exoplanetsurveys have found rocky worlds similar to the terrestrial planets, as well as gas giants and ice giants like those we know here (though sometimes in exotic locations). There are also exoplanets that may have surfaces covered entirely bywater, perhaps representing a whole new category of planetary composition. The more we discover about the worlds in our Solar System and beyond, the better we understand the mechanics of the Universe. And by searching for worlds in other star systems, we may even someday find one that has a feature we’ve only seen once:life.

Title: The hottest and coldest places in the Solar System
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/the-hottest-and-coldest-places-in-the-solar-system
Detailed Text:
Kate Howells•Apr 23, 2024
We all know that space is cool, but some places in the Solar System are cooler than others — literally. There is an extremely wide range of temperatures throughout our cosmic neighborhood, from the searing heat of the Sun to the icy outer reaches of the Oort Cloud. Here’s our list of some of the hottest and coldest places in the Solar System. As you might guess,the Sunholds the title of hottest place in the Solar System. Its core reaches temperatures of about 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), fueling the warmth we depend on here on Earth.
One of the Sun’s biggest mysteries is that its outer atmosphere, also called the corona, is much hotter than its surface. The corona is heated to more than 1 million degrees Celsius (2 million degrees Fahrenheit), while the surface temperature remains a comparatively cool 5,800 degrees Celsius (about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit). NASA’sParker Solar Probeis studying the corona from within to try to understand this phenomenon. Io, one of Jupiter’s major moons, has some of the highest surface temperatures in the Solar System not because of the Sun’s heat, but because of its extreme volcanic activity. This relatively small world is themost volcanically active bodyin the Solar System, with roughly 400 active volcanoes dotting its surface. These volcanoes erupt lava and gasses, sometimes reaching temperatures of  more than 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit).
Io gets its heat from internal friction caused by an eccentric orbit aroundJupiter. As Io gets closer to and farther from Jupiter, the gravitational ebb and flowdistorts the shape of the moon. This squeezing and stretching creates friction. Inside Io, the heat caused by all this friction is enough to melt rock into magma. Although Earth’s volcanoes also produce super-heated lava, eruptions on Earth aren’t as frequent as they are on Io. That’s why Jupiter’s volcanic little moon edges our planet out in the category of red hot lava world. Despite not being the closest planet to the Sun,Venushas the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System. On the surface of Venus, temperatures can reach around 460 degrees Celsius (860 degrees Fahrenheit). This is hot enough tomelt lead.
These searing temperatures are caused by Venus’ thick atmosphere, which is composed mainly of carbon dioxide. As we know from its role in climate change onEarth, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. When the Sun’s light heats Venus, the heat can’t efficiently radiate back into space because it’s trapped by the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This heats the planet up dramatically. As logic would suggest, the farther you go from the Sun, the colder things get. This is why the Oort Cloud, the group oficy objectsextending from about 2,000 to 100,000 astronomical units (the average Sun-Earth distance, also know as AUs) from the Sun, likely hosts some of the coldest environments in our Solar System. While we haven’t studied any of these objects up-close in their home environment, the inner Solar System does sometimes get visitors from the Oort Cloud: comets.
Although we have not yet been able to take direct temperature readings of objects in the Oort Cloud, theoretical calculations suggest that objects in the outer parts of the region could be just a few degrees above absolute zero (the coldest possible temperature). The farthest object ever visited by a spacecraft is Arrokoth, a trans-Neptunian object located in the Kuiper belt beyond Pluto. NASA’sNew Horizonsspacecraft flew past Arrokoth in 2019 after completing its primary mission to studyPluto. New Horizons took surface temperature measurements of both icy worlds, and found Arrokoth to be the colder of the two — as would be expected due to its greater distance from the Sun. Arrokoth is the coldest Solar System object to have its temperature measured up close.
Arrokoth’s surface temperature is estimated to be about -230 degrees Celsius (-384 degrees Fahrenheit). Arrokoth’s frigid temperature isn’t just because of its distance; it’s also made of fairly bright material, meaning it reflects a lot of the sunlight that reaches it instead of absorbing it. The unexpected member of this category isEarth’s Moon— the exception to the general rule of thumb of “farther from the Sun equals colder.” It isn’t the Moon’s entire surface, but certain regions that earn the Moon its place among the coldest worlds. Deep within craters, primarily near the Moon’s poles, there are some areas on the Moon that have not received direct sunlight for potentially billions of years. These permanently shadowed regions have temperatures as low as -233 degrees Celsius (-387 degrees Fahrenheit) — colder than Pluto and even Arrokoth.
These extreme temperatures allow water ice to remain frozen instead of sublimating directly into a gas. This makes permanently shadowed regions of particular interest for future exploration of the Moon, since their water could be a valuable resource for human explorers. Mercurygets a special shout-out for being the world with the most extreme temperature swings in the Solar System. This has to do with Mercury’s proximity to the Sun, orbital and rotational speeds, and lack of substantial atmosphere.
A Mercury day (the time it takes to rotate from one noon to the next) is 176 Earth days long. It completes an orbit around the Sun in about 88 Earth days. This means that its periods of daylight and nighttime are very long, allowing surface temperatures to rise very high during the day and drop precipitously at night. The difference between the day side and night side is even more extreme than on a planet like Earth because Mercury doesn’t have a substantial atmosphere to trap and regulate heat. Taken together, these factors cause Mercury to experience extreme differences in temperature between its day and night sides. During the day, Mercury’s surface can reach up to about 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit), and at night, temperatures can drop to as low as -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) — a swing of up to 610 degrees Celsius (1,090 degrees Fahrenheit). While other worlds hold records for most extreme heat and cold, none compare to Mercury when it comes to dramatic temperature swings.

Title: At Eclipse-O-Rama, cosmic beauty and community

Detailed Text:
Asa Stahl•Apr 18, 2024
As darkness fell, the entire crowd — hundreds of people — went silent with concentration, straining to see through the thick clouds. For a moment, the only sound was the eerie, rushing wind. Then the clouds parted. Cheers erupted at the sight of the eclipse. Bill Nye, standing among the crowd, looked up and gasped. “Oh,” he sighed, “it’s as if by magic…” Even before totality, spirits were high at Eclipse-O-Rama 2024. Members of The Planetary Society had come to a ranch outside Fredericksburg, Texas, not just to marvel at the total solar eclipse, but for community and adventure. People from all over the world gathered to explore and celebrate their love of space, goals that had nothing to do with how the weather turned out.
The festival was a place to learn and connect with like-minded people, “to be part of something much, much bigger,” said Adam Romero, an attendee from Folsom, California. “As soon as we noticed The Planetary Society was doing something like this,” he added, “we had to jump on it.” Attendees came together to share their interests, discover new things about space, and just hang out and have fun. On the festival’s acres of grassy ranchland, amid fields of wildflowers and cattle, people shared “love stories” of how they first became passionate about space. They played games, watched movies, and gathered around telescopes to view the moons of Jupiter and the Orion nebula. In a glass-walled chapel — typically meant for weddings — attendees packed the room to hear talks by Planetary Society scientists Bethany Ehlmann, Heidi Hammel, and Bruce Betts. Each speaker focused on one of the Society’s three main priorities in turn, updating members on the latest in planetary defense, exploration, and the search for life.
Planetary Society staff and members had the pleasure of mingling more casually, too. Throughout the eclipse, Planetary Radio host Sarah Al-Ahmed rubbed shoulders with the crowd and interviewed anyone eager to share their story. Digital community manager Ambre Trujillo made videos with kids at the activity tent. Astronomer and Planetary Society vice president Heidi Hammel, who brought her family to Eclipse-O-Rama, shared a game of space bingo with other members. For Avry Anderson, an attendee from Boise, Idaho, the opportunity to engage with the team was one of the highlights of Eclipse-O-Rama, especially as a listener of Planetary Radio. “Just seeing all these faces I’ve only ever heard,” he said, “it’s very exciting.” Every attendee also had the chance to meet Bill Nye, The Planetary Society’s CEO, and a select few had the chance to do even more. Valerie Sinha of Houston, Texas, won a sweepstakes through Planetary Society partner Prizeo that put her on stage watching the eclipse beside Bill Nye. She also shared a meal with other team members, such as Heidi Hammel and senior communications adviser Mat Kaplan.
“They're incredibly wonderful, kind people,” Sinha said. “This has been absolutely a blast.” Eclipse-O-Rama reached many more people than just those who were there in person. The event was featured on CNN with Anderson Cooper, CBS News, and The Weather Channel. Tim Dodd (The Everyday Astronaut) live-streamed the eclipse to hundreds of thousands of online viewers. And over a quarter of a million people used The Eclipse App — developed in a collaboration between The Planetary Society and The Eclipse Company — to count down to totality. When that countdown hit zero and the clouds parted over Eclipse-O-Rama, everyone present shared a moment of joy, beauty, and awe. And then it was over. People shook their heads in disbelief. “Amazing” was the word on everybody’s lips. A chant began for “Spain, 2026!” — one of the sites of the next total solar eclipse. Stephanie Abrams, meteorologist for The Weather Channel, wiped tears from her eyes. “Listen, this is my third eclipse now,” she said. “This was the most vibrant one I’ve ever seen.”

Title: Is space science worth the money?

Detailed Text:
Kate Howells•Apr 16, 2024
Space science costs money. To study the Universe and the worlds within it, we have to employ scientists, build observatories and research facilities, and launch spacecraft — among other things. So why is it worth the money? What does space science do for society? Space science is a broad field that includes disciplines like astrophysics, cosmology, planetary science, and the study of space weather and space environments. Space science uses observational tools such as optical and radio telescopes, exploration missions such as orbiters and rovers, computational and theoretical methods, and more. All of this work aims to understand the origin, evolution, structure, and mechanics of the Cosmos and all that exists within it. Space science, like other forms of basic science, is donefor the sake of better understandingthe natural Universe in which we live. This has inherent value in and of itself. For as long as human civilization has existed, we have valued inquiry, discovery, and knowledge. Although practical applications of science have done wonderful things for our world, from medicine to flight to computing and much more, basic scienceis of valuebecausewe don’t know what we will discover.Some of what we learn will be valuable purely for the understanding and insight that it generates — but other discoveries may themselves become directly applicable to making our lives better, healthier, or improving our societies. This is the primary reason why we do space science: to know more about the Cosmos and ourselves. The process of conducting space science also provides a societal benefit by being interrogative, rational, and collaborative. A society that cultivates these kinds of qualities enriches itself. That cultural richness is part of what gives science, including space science, value. Both the outcome (scientific knowledge) and the process (scientific inquiry) of space science are primary benefits.
Although governments around the world understand the value of basic science, it can be hard to prioritize its funding given the variety of competing needs within a nation. NASA’s space science programs in 2024 amount to roughly 0.1% of annual U.S. spending, which represents a decrease in recent years. As such, space science sometimes needs to rely on justifications beyond its intrinsic value. In afamous 2007 speech, former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin differentiated between the “real” and “acceptable” reasons for exploring space. “Acceptable” reasons for space exploration are logical, quantifiable, policy-friendly justifications. The “real” reasons, on the other hand, are intuitive, grand, emotional, and difficult to quantify. Both types of reasons are valid, and together they help explain why space science is worth the investment. Some of the “acceptable” reasons for space science involve economic payoffs. Research has found that countries that invest more in basic research, including space science,see a return on investmentin their overall economic performance and growth. This effect is dispersed throughout the economy through highly skilled, well-paying jobs. It also has anindirect effecton the economy: Discovery leads to technology and invention, which leads to new products, jobs, and industries. While technology development isn’t the primary goal of space science, this kind of progresswould eventually stagnateif basic scientific research were neglected. Another policy-friendly reason to invest in space science is that many scientific missions are internationally collaborative and contribute to allyship with other nations. There is also the very pragmatic goal of understanding Earth, the planet on which we all depend, by studying other planets and their histories. Venus, for example, was once an Earth-like world that eventuallydevolved into an inhospitable hellscape. By understanding that planet, we can work to prevent a similar fate for our own. But, as Griffinexplains, much of what humans do, from falling in love with one’s spouse to enjoying one genre of music more than another, is based on emotional and intuitive motivations. This is a human characteristic, and it plays out in our drive to understand the Universe and our place within it. In many ways, this is why we invest in space science: we want to go to new places and discover new things, witness the beauty and majesty of the Cosmos, understand where we came from and what might be possible in our future, and achieve astonishing feats. Awe, wonder, and inspiration are among the “real” reasons for conducting space science. These are benefits that people can enjoy but that are impossible to quantify or justify on a budget balance sheet. Still, they are some of the most powerful motivators for studying the Universe and our place within it.
The vast majority of space science is funded by governments. This is true of many scientific fields since basic science (as opposed to applied science, such as pharmaceutical development) isn’t conducted for the benefit of shareholders or investors, but for the benefit of the public. All of the reasons (both real and acceptable) why space science is worthwhile involve benefits that are shared among national, if not global, populations. WhenJWSTsends back a mind-boggling image of a nebula, we all get to bask in the beauty of the Cosmos. When the Ingenuity Mars helicopterfirst took flight, we all got to marvel at the human accomplishment of flying a robot on another world. When life is somedaydiscovered beyond Earth, all of humanity will be able to contemplate what it means to be a living thing in the Universe. Space science is inherently for the public good and requires the kind of investments that governments are best positioned to make. By pooling together the resources of an entire population, we can enable great things that individuals or even corporations couldn’t afford to do alone. If you want to help build public support for space science funding, you can talk to others about the many reasons why it’s worth the investment. Depending on who you’re talking to, you might focus more on “real” reasons or “acceptable” reasons. For some people, the meaningfulness of scientific discovery might resonate more. For others, it might be the economic benefits. Many people will resonate with both types of justification. The Planetary Society is dedicated to advocating for scientific space exploration. Bybecoming a memberand joining our advocacy efforts like the annualDay of Action, you can help us make sure that the decision-makers who set NASA’s budget know just how important space science is to our world.

Title: How do NASA and ESA work together?
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/how-do-nasa-and-esa-work-together
Detailed Text:
NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have a long-standing partnership that has resulted in spectacular science missions, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn. ESA and the European Union (EU) are distinct organizations of European states with similar goals of expanding the space capabilities of the continent. ESA has an ambitious scientific exploration program in the works, and collaborations with NASA play an important role, including in the return of scientifically significant samples from Mars.
Gone are the days of national space agencies going it alone in the exploration of outer space. No agency better exemplifies this shift than the European Space Agency. If your phone or desktop background is an image from theJames Webb Space Telescope, you can thank the partnership between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) for making it possible. But before diving into the origin and benefits of partnerships like this, it’s important to understand ESA and its role in space exploration. ESA is not like other national space agencies in that it is not operated by a singular nation. Instead, ESA is an international organization comprised of 22 Member States, four Associate Member States, and multiple cooperative agreements with European and North American partners. The Member and Associate Member States form the Council of Ministers, each with one vote. Canada also has a vote on the Council due to the nature of its agreement with the agency. This Council determines the direction, budget, and priorities for the agency in three-year increments. This structure allows the agency to pool resources and undertake more ambitious programs while maintaining distinct national agencies with their own agenda and specialties. Each member of ESA contributes a portion of the overall agency budget. Uniquely, ESA invests in each member state at a level equivalent to the country’s contribution to the budget.
Not quite. The European Union (EU) and ESA are distinct organizations. The EU is a supranational organization, meaning that it exists beyond the national governments of its European member states. ESA is an intergovernmental organization, existing between the governments of its member states. However, there is much overlap between the EU and ESA as both work to increase Europe’s participation in space activities.
After the formalization of an agreement between Croatia and ESA,the agency established formal ties to all EU Member Statesthat were not already ESA members. The EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) is the EU’s counterpart to ESA, and the two groups hold regular Space Council meetings, similar to the U.S. National Space Council, to identify key programmatic goals and develop an overall coherent strategy for the advancement of space activities in Europe. And while neither ESA nor the EU get involved in international agreements like the Outer Space Treaty or Artemis Accords, the agency’s constituent members do. Of the 22 Member States, 10 have signed the Artemis Accords. All 22 Member States, four Associate Member States, and all but one cooperating partner have ratified the Outer Space Treaty. There are many benefits to engaging international partners in the exploration of space, such as pooling resources, leveraging expertise across national borders, and diffusing risk, which all enhance the overall capacity for scientific discovery and technological innovation. This collaboration allows for more ambitious missions, which would be significantly more challenging for a single country to undertake both financially and technically. Partnerships like that between ESA and NASA not only accelerate the pace of scientific advancement but also foster goodwill and mutual understanding among participating nations, laying the groundwork for peaceful cooperation in space exploration. The opportunities that open up for collaboration do not occur on a regular schedule. Instead, each agency has its own processes for the selection, formulation, and implementation of missions. Normally, the decision of if and how to engage with international partners happens early in the lifecycle of a mission. Mission architects will consider multiple options at each decision point in developing their plan, weighing the scientific, technical, and logistical merits of potential collaborations against the backdrop of political, financial, and strategic considerations. This early integration ensures that the contributions from all parties are incorporated into the mission architecture. Such collaborations, though complex, are facilitated by a shared commitment to exploration and discovery, underpinned by detailed agreements that outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of each partner. This has the added benefit of developing political strength for missions to weather budget and schedule uncertainty, as well as geopolitical strains. ESA and NASA have a long-standing partnership on a variety of space missions, dating back to the earliest days of both agencies. ESA has been involved in many of NASA’s largest, most ambitious, and scientifically significant missions. This is in large part due to the past successes of the ESA-NASA partnership to deliver revolutionary science. Cassini-Huygens:This mission was a collaboration between NASA and ESA, with additional support from the Italian Space Agency. The mission comprised two main elements: the Cassini orbiter, developed and managed by NASA, and the Huygens probe, provided by ESA. The collaboration was structured around a division of responsibilities that leveraged the strengths of each partner. ESA's contribution, the Huygens probe, was designed to detach from the Cassini orbiter and descend onto the surface ofTitan, Saturn's largest moon. The Italian Space Agency supplied the high-gain antenna for the Cassini orbiter and other critical hardware components. This ambitious endeavor marked the first and, to date, only landing in the outer Solar System. ESA's involvement was instrumental in maintaining the mission's scientific objectives despite budgetary constraints and the restructuring of the project by NASA. The Huygens probe paved the way for future missions to Titan, namely theDragonflymission being developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. James Webb Space Telescope:The partnership between ESA and NASA on the flagship observatory was inspired by the resounding success of theHubble Space Telescope, prompting the agencies to come together in 1996 with the ambitious goal of developing Hubble's scientific successor. ESA's commitment was solidified in 2003, with its contributions becoming a cornerstone of the project by 2007. The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), designed to ESA's specifications and built by Airbus Defence and Space in Germany, incorporates detector and micro-shutter subsystems provided by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Another instrument, the  Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), embodies the transatlantic partnership, developed jointly by European institutions and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the U.S. ESA launched JWST atop the Ariane 5 rocket on Dec. 25, 2021, placing the spacecraft at Sun-Earth L2. The European Ariane 5 performed so well that the spacecraft has enough fuel left tosupport an extended lifespan beyond 10 years. The minimum benchmark is five years. This collaboration has ensured ESA's full partnership in the JWST mission, granting European astronomers equal access to the telescope's observations and guaranteeing them at least 15% of the observatory's total observing time.
Despite recent budget cuts to NASA, the global investment in space has never been higher. That is in large part because of agencies like ESA. At the agency’s last ministerial-level meeting in 2022, the governing council approveda 17% increase in the budgetfor ESA. This increase has enabled the agency to support upcoming efforts in collaboration with NASA. EnVision:The largest proportion of ESA’s current budget is its Earth Observation program, indicating an established interest in climate science for the agency. It’s no wonder then that one of the agency’s first decisions of 2024 was to formally approve its next M-class (medium-sized) mission to be EnVision, a Venus orbiter.Venusis a compelling case study in the evolution of terrestrial planets from habitable to hellscape. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab is providing the Venus Synthetic Aperture Radar (VenSAR) instrument to help the spacecraft peer beneath the clouds to study the atmosphere, surface, subsurface, and interior of the planet. The mission aims to unravel why Venus, despite itssimilarities to Earthin size, composition, and solar distance, embarked on a radically different evolutionary path. The mission benefits from the legacy of missions such as ESA's Venus Express and NASA’s Magellan spacecraft while incorporating insights from NASA's forthcoming Venus missions, Goddard Space Flight Center’sDAVINCIand JPL’sVERITAS. Mars Sample Return:In order to bring the samples collected by thePerseverancerover back to Earth, NASA and ESA are collaborating on a multi-phased program that involves multiple interconnected components. While NASA has collected the samples and will launch them into orbit, ESA has committed over a billion euros to the development of the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO). The ERO will autonomously rendezvous with the samples in orbit and bring them back to Earth. While MSR undergoes a reformulation followingan Independent Review Board report in 2023that identified managerial and technical concerns for the ambitious flagship program, ESA has remained steadfast in its commitment to supporting the first-ever return of samples from another planetary body. Artemis:The ESA-NASA collaboration on the Artemis program exemplifies a groundbreaking partnership aimed at propelling human exploration beyond the familiar bounds of low-Earth orbit to the Moon and, eventually, Mars. With ESA providing the European Service Module (ESM) — the very "powerhouse" of the Orion spacecraft — this collaboration is essential to the success of future Artemis missions. The ESM is critical, providing astronauts with electricity, water, oxygen, and nitrogen and ensuring proper temperature and course maintenance for the spacecraft. The Artemis program has now survived multiple challenges that ended prior lunar return efforts, including a presidential transition and an agency-wide budget cut. This is a testament to the shared commitment of ESA and NASA to overcoming the complexities of deep space exploration, setting the stage for a new era of human and robotic exploration of our Solar System.

Title: Experiencing the total solar eclipse without sight

Detailed Text:
Jason Davis•Apr 03, 2024
Solar eclipses are usually described in visual terms: The Moon moves in front of the Sun, the sky darkens, and the Sun’s wispy, white corona appears. That’s how most people willexperience the total solar eclipseon April 8, 2024. The majority of North America will see a partial solar eclipse, and for those in a narrow strip known as thepath of totality, the Moon will completely blot out the Sun for a few minutes. For people with blindness or low vision, the eclipse can also be experienced without sight. New technologies, projects, and resources aim to make this year’s eclipse more inclusive, helping as many people as possible experience this extraordinary cosmic event. A small, handheld device will allow people to experience the eclipse through sound instead of light. Created by Harvard astronomer Allyson Bieryla,LightSoundis a small box that converts light levels into sound through a process called sonification. A sensor records the amount of light coming from the Sun and outputs a corresponding sound through an audio jack that can be connected to headphones or a speaker. When the Sun is unobstructed, LightSound emits a high-pitched tone. As the Moon covers the Sun, the tone decreases, ending at a series of clicks when the Sun is blocked completely. As the Moon slides off the Sun, the tone gradually increases back to the original pitch.
Bieryla got the idea for LightSound when she was reviewing student lab accessibility as the manager of Harvard’s Astronomy Lab and Clay Telescope in 2017. She had a discussion withWanda Díaz-Merced, a blind astronomer who uses sonification to study astronomical data sets. “We wanted to create something low-cost and easy to make, to give the blind and low-vision community a way to experience the eclipse through sound,” Bieryla said. Díaz-Merced experienced her first eclipse in the 1990s, when she still had partial vision. As the sky began to darken, she remembers noticing what was happening through senses other than sight. “I felt it on my skin, I felt it through my ears, I felt it through all the senses I had available, because life gave me the opportunity to pay attention in a different way,” she said. Bieryla’s team developed a LightSound prototype for the 2017 total solar eclipse and has been refining it ever since. The design is open source, and the team shipped out free units that they built themselves or produced through workshops where participants learn how to solder electronic components. They produced around 900 devices for the 2024 total solar eclipse. “We've been humbled by how many requests we have gotten for these devices, and the enormous amount of thanks from people and organizers for creating this tool,” Bieryla said. “I hope this project impacts people in a positive way and inspires a few new budding astronomers.” For the past two decades, NASA has been producing and distributingbraille booksto schools and institutions that support people who are blind or have low vision. These limited edition, handmade books allow people to use touch to discover everything from lunar craters tosolar eclipses. The agency’s “Getting a Feel for Eclipses” book explains how eclipses work and uses tactile graphics to show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth. Readers can also trace the path of totality as it crosses the United States.
Another way to experience the eclipse through senses other than sight isEclipse Soundscapes, a NASA citizen science project. Eclipse Soundscapes will study the impact of the eclipse on the environment throughmultisensory observations. It builds on a study from a 1932 eclipse in which the public was asked to observe animal and insect behavior and report their observations to scientists. Participants can use all of their available senses to document what happens during the eclipse, collect data using a specialized recording device called AudioMoth, and help analyze data after the eclipse. The Eclipse Soundscapes smartphone app includes audio descriptions and haptic feedback to teach people about eclipses, and the AudioMoth recording device hastactile cuesto assist people with blindness or low vision. “We have intentionally made this project as inclusive and accessible as possible so that people who are blind or low-vision can participate alongside their sighted peers,” said Kelsey Perrett, a representative for the project. “Eclipses are amazing events, and we want everyone to be able to experience the eclipse and participate in this exciting opportunity to gather research.”
Nearly 700 people have signed up to be eclipse observers, and about 1,000 people have signed up to be data collectors. The Eclipse Soundscapes and LightSound projects will help turn what is usually thought of as a visual event into a multisensory experience. “It was a fun project,” said Karl Smith, who participated in atrial runof the Soundscapes project during the 2023 annular eclipse. “I just really enjoyed participating. Who thinks of blind people in astronomy?”

Title: Should you be worried about solar storms?
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/should-you-be-worried-about-solar-storms
Detailed Text:
Asa Stahl•Mar 26, 2024
The danger of a major solar storm is now at its highest in over a decade. As the Sun reaches the peak of its activity cycle, the odds of such a storm hitting Earth rise along with its associated risks, including blackouts, disabled satellites, and damaged cell phones and GPS networks. In the most extreme scenarios, some power grids could be knocked out for weeks or even months. But that is the worst case. With the right precautions, solar activity could be a net positive for humanity, as it constantly protects us against harmful radiation from beyond the Solar System. Whether we risk the dangers or reap the benefits of living with the Sun will come down to the same thing: our ability to predict and prepare for whatour staris going to do next. “The Sun will do what the Sun wants,” saysNour Rawafi, project scientist for NASA’sParker Solar Probemission and astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), which built and operates the probe from Laurel, Maryland. Quebec learned this lesson in 1989, when a solar stormknocked outthe province’s power for nine hours. The U.S. military experienced it in 1972, when solar activitytriggered dozens of minesfloating off the coast of Vietnam. And almost the entire world witnessed it in 1859 when, for about a day, the aurora borealisglowed so brightthat it could be seen as far south as Colombia. People in the U.S. read newspapers by the light in the sky. Gold miners woke up in the middle of the night, thinking it was morning, and started making breakfast. The 1859 geomagnetic storm, now known as the Carrington Event, was the strongest in recorded history. It was caused when a wave of magnetized plasma launched from the Sun, traveling at over 2,000 kilometers per second (about 1,500 miles per second), and then hit Earth. The wave of plasma, called acoronal mass ejection(orCME), led Earth’s magnetic field to release terawatts of power in response.
The same thing could happen today. But predictions for this solar cycle vary greatly: some scientists have put the odds of a roughly Carrington-level storm at about 1%, while others have gone as high as around 25%. How likely is it that we’re actually hit by such a powerful solar storm? “Honestly, we don’t know,” says Rawafi. He argues that doesn’t matter. Though we may be fine most of the time, it will only take one incident to change everything — and it is only a matter of time. “There is no way around it,” he goes on. “We are living with the Sun.” Experts have tried to imagine the impact. As theEarth’s magnetic fieldchanges in response to a solar storm, it can cause huge currents in power lines that blow out transformers and compromise electrical grids. Studies of the United States alone have predicted that a major solar storm would leave tens of millions of people without power, some for weeks, months, or even years. The economic damage would be in the range of trillions of dollars. According to Rawafi, these estimates don’t go far enough. The real impact is “beyond the scale of our comprehension,” he says. “It’s way, way beyond that.” A huge solar storm would disable satellites, especially communications satellites in higher orbits. It wouldmess with GPS signals, which are used by everything from cell phone networks to power grids. Taken alongside wide-ranging blackouts, which would also knock out pumps essential to the water supply, a Carrington-like storm could simultaneously damage almost all major aspects of modern infrastructure: power, food, water, transportation, security, and communication. With that much impaired, it’s easy to imagine problems in different sectors magnifying each other — and that’s on a sunny day. What if the storm hit during winter, when people rely on the power grid to stave off potentially deadly cold?
A storm could alsocripplethe internet. Most of the digital traffic between continents is carried by undersea cables, which use components that might get fried by a big geomagnetic storm. That would limit the internet to mostly function within more local networks. Those, in turn, might be compromised by the storm in other ways. The impact of a major solar storm would vary greatly around the world, depending on a region’s power grid, proximity to water, location relative to the Earth’s magnetic field, and even geology, which determines how good of a conductor the ground is. For a combination of these reasons, places like China, North America, and Australia may be more susceptible to blackouts than much of the rest of the world. The metropolitan corridor spanning Washington, D.C. and New York City has been described as particularly vulnerable. In the face of such potential disaster, our best hope is to learn more about the Sun-Earth system, monitor solar activity, and develop our ability to predict space weather. It’s like forecasting normal weather, Rawafi says: the more you understand the system, the better you can predict what it will do. This is no easy task when it comes to our star. The Sun iscomplex and not yet well understood, and scientists must also get a better handle on how its emissions travel through space and affect Earth. Compared to forecasting the normal weather, Rawafi says our space weather predictions are about 50 years behind. That’s why missions like the Parker Solar Probe — the first spacecraft ever totouch the Sun— are all the more important. Launched in 2018, Parker has already made several discoveries about how the Sun transports energy outward into space. In 2022, Parker even flew directly through a CME. The spacecraft’s data have helped scientists improve their ability to predict exactly when an event at the Sun will later reach Earth. Establishing that timing is important, Rawafi explains, because it’s an essential first step to an early warning system that would help avoid a worst-case scenario.
Yet he warns that our current projects are not enough. Parker is not designed to act as a full-time warning system, and it can only study the Sun from one angle at a time. Rawafi suggests a constellation of satellites around the Sun, almost like Starlink around Earth, in order to completely surveil the Sun and always be ready to relay warnings back to Earth. “We have to start thinking big,” Rawafi says. “We have to be bold.” Despite its destructive potential, solar activity is not just a matter of doom and gloom. We could owe it our very existence, as some studies have found that solar activity might havecatalyzedthedevelopment of lifeon Earth. Ironically, solar activity also keeps us safe: emission from the Sun shields us from even deadlier radiation that comes from the galaxy at large. This means that forfuture astronautson voyages away from Earth’s magnetic field, times of heightened solar activity might actually be ideal. Since the Sun is a stronger buffer when it’s more active, astronauts would be safest from galactic harm when solar storms are most likely. That timing would put a mission more at risk of getting hit by a CME — but if we could monitor and predict solar weather, it might be possible to minimize local threats while protecting astronauts from galactic ones. Humanity has options. When the next big storm hits us, the aftermath could look very different depending on what we do today. We can design satellites to be more resistant to geomagnetic storms. We can harden our power grids, especially our transformers, like Quebec spent over $1 billion doing after its power outage. Though U.S. electrical transmission providers recently began this process, their precautions seem to be designed withweaker storms in mind, not Carrington-level events. And, as Rawafi suggests, we can dedicate more resources to solar science. NOAA’s Space Weather Follow On – Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1) mission and NASA’s Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) will both monitorthe Sunand provide data to help predict space weather. Both are set to launch in 2025.
Meanwhile, the Parker Solar Probe will make its closest approach to the Sun in late 2024. The NASA spacecraft will beat its own record for the fastest human-made object, reachingspeeds of almost 700,000 kilometers per hour(435,000 miles per hour). Though Parker’s primary mission will end in 2025, Rawafi says the probe is in perfect health, “like we launched it yesterday.” His team hopes to keep it going for as long as they can. After all, a mission like Parker is a rare opportunity. The data it collects will be crucial to efforts to understand our Sun, and they may ultimately help decide what impact the next big storm has on humanity. “Its mission,” Rawafi says, “will serve generations to come.”

Title: NASA's FY 2025 budget request is not enough
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/nasas-fy-2025-budget-request-is-not-enough
Detailed Text:
Casey Dreier•Mar 25, 2024
The Biden Administration released its 2025 budget request for NASA on March 11, 2024. Under this proposal, NASA's topline would grow by 2% relative to 2024, to $25.4 billion. The budget also projects regular 2% topline increases to the space agency in the coming years, reaching $27.5 billion by 2029. This is a substantial departure from the Biden Administration's prior aspirations, which last year had projected growth to nearly the same amount — $27.2 billion — by 2025. The difference between last year's projection and the actual request is nearly $1.8 billion. Inflation further compounds the problem. Even though the 2025 budget nominally provides a 2% bump relative to 2024, it would still represent a$2 billion lossin buying power for NASA since 2020. Even the projected 2% annual growth will not keep pace with inflation, resulting in a slow bleed of resources from the space agency in the coming years.
NASA topline amounts, with FY 2025 PBR projections through 2029, all normalized to 2025 dollars.Inflation calculations are fromNASA's New Start Indexusinghistorical adjustments through 2024 and then an estimatedaverage of 2.6% annual inflation starting in 2025.
Spending constraints passed by Congressare behind this change of fortune. In the summer of 2023, a divided Congress effectively froze total federal spending on agencies like NASA for fiscal years 2024 and 2025. The Biden Administration is working within this cap. That said, this budget makes decisions within those constraints that inject uncertainty into the United States's space science and engineering workforce, pit missions and scientific communities against each other, threaten the cohesion of the planetary science community, and limit the pursuit of new scientific breakthroughs. The request for NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is $7.6 billion. This is $231 million more than 2024 but $226 million below its 2023 amount. Of NASA's $2 billion loss of buying power since 2020, half—$1 billion—will come from the SMD in this proposal, even though science comprises only a third of the space agency's total budget. As a consequence, the FY 2025 budget request cancels, defers, or leaves a number of key projects in states of profound uncertainty. This money proposed simply cannot enable the major priority projects in Heliophysics, Planetary Science, Earth Science, and Astrophysics recommended by the scientific community via the decadal survey processes.
Annual budgets for NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), including projections from the FY 2025 budget request. All normalized to 2025 dollars. Inflation adjustments via NASA's New Start Index.
Notably, the flagship mission from Heliophysics, theGeospace Dynamics Constellation, is outright canceled. TheHabitable Worlds Observatoryproject, now ensconced into a program office thanks to congressional action in 2024, does better, receiving $50 million to pursue technology maturation efforts as directed by the Astrophysics Decadal Survey, though this is far from the amounts needed to pursue the full project in the 2030s. If these budgetary trends continue, no top-priority flagship missions — which require billions of dollars over the coming decade — will be possible within a balanced portfolio in any of NASA's science divisions, whether it beMars Sample Return, Habitable Worlds Observatory, or the Geospace Dynamics Constellation.

Under this proposal, the Planetary Science Division would receive $2.7 billion in FY 2025, $500 million less than in 2023 and a mere $15 million more than the enacted 2024 levels. Many projects stand to receive solid funding.DragonflyandNEO Surveyorare supported for 2028 launch dates,VERITASis restored (though delayed until 2031, along withDAVINCI),commercial lunar payload missionscontinue at a brisk pace, and funding for fundamental research would increase. However, the start of the next generation of small- and mid-class planetary missions is delayed until 2026 due to the cost growth of both Dragonfly and the two Venus missions.

Mars Sample Return (MSR), the top priority of the planetary science community in the coming decade, is of particular concern. It emerged from the 2024 budget battered and bruised, with "no less" than $300 million, a far cry from the previous year's $822 million allocated by Congress. The project did, however, secure budgetary flexibility, and NASA can spend upwards of $949 million if necessary. However, the Planetary Science Division, which accounts for the budget of MSR, was itself cut by nearly $500 million. Exactly how much the project needs in 2024 is to be determined, as it is paused pending theresults of an internal reviewand re-formulation. Anyone seeking clarity on MSR in the FY 2025 budget was sorely disappointed. Instead of a budgetary request for the program, Mars Sample Return received an unprecedented placeholder of "TBD":
This is exceedingly rare, if not outright unique in the history of NASA budget proposals. In the most generous interpretation, the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which approves and controls funding requests to federal agencies, was reluctant to request any funding until NASA announced its path forward for MSR, despite clear support for the value of the project and NASA's science portfolio writ large in the FY 2024 appropriations report. This is not entirely unreasonable. However, the Planetary Science budget remains frozen at $2.7 billion in this proposal, $500 million less than it received in 2023 when MSR was funded at $822 million. NASA leadership has stated that any restart of Mars Sample Return in 2025 will not augur an increase to the Planetary Science Division's budget. And while there appears to be $200 million tucked away in the planetary division's Outer Planets account, seemingly reserved for MSR's restart, that is far from enough to pursue even a leaner and lower-cost sample return effort. Any additional funding for MSR will be cannibalized from other projects. This is not a supposition. The budget request itself says that due to MSR: "funding levels for Planetary Science missions are subject to change." Or, to rephrase it slightly: "that's a nice budget for planetary science you have there —would be a shame if anything happened to it". The Office of Management and Budget, essentially the White House's accounting office, controls the budget proposal process and hashistorically been skepticalof large science missions like MSR. The fact that the FY2025 president's budget neglected to request any money for MSR, but went to great lengths to specify alternate budgetary scenarios for other missions — scenarios it itself says are not realistic — will only serve to drive a further wedge between MSR and other planetary priorities. Though the top priority of the current planetary decadal survey, there has beenconsternationamong the scientific community regarding its cost and lack of near-term scientific return, and a persistent worry that MSR might grow so large as to imbalance, disrupt, and delay other important planetary science missions.The Planetary Society, while supportive of MSR, believes strongly in maintaining balance across NASA's science portfolio. The budget request appears to lay a trap for Mars Sample Return. NASA leadership would be wise to avoid springing it. NASA must secure a supplemental request for MSR’s restart, and Congress must be willing to restore funding to the science directorate to support it. It is neither reasonable nor realistic to expect a restart of Mars Sample Return with half a billion dollars missing from NASA’s science budget.
Annual budgets for NASA's Deep Space Exploration Systems, including projections from the FY 2025 budget request. This incorporates funding for the SLS, Orion, Human Landing System, Gateway, and related systems. All normalized to 2025 dollars. Inflation adjustments via NASA's New Start Index.
Project Artemishas cleared two hurdles that felled prior attempts to return humans to the Moon: the first was surviving a Presidential transition in 2021; the second, in 2024, was securing a congressional budget that grew funding for Artemis despite a decrease in NASA's topline. The diverse political coalition behind Artemis has proven resilient, and will likely do so again. That doesn't spare Artemis from feeling the pinch, though its overall funding position remains strong. Compared to 2024, Artemis's budget would decrease by only ½ of 1%. Funding does shift around some, with Orion and SLS's shift into production status freeing up funds used to bump up funding for new lunar spacesuits (+14%) and continue the Gateway station development, and $1.9 billion to support the two companies creating the new human lunar landers, SpaceX and Blue Origin. Of course, inflation impacts Artemis as much as any other directorate at NASA, and a flat budget relative to 2024 still amounts to a loss of nearly $200 million in buying power. Artemis, however, is structured quite differently than NASA's science missions, having leveraged fixed-price or services-based contracts for the majority of its components.  This means that Artemis is, in theory, somewhat protected from inflation, as these contracts generally place the onus of cost growth on the industry partner, not NASA. The SLS and Orion projects are moving out of development and into a regular production cadence, meaning that their costs are unlikely to spike, barring some significant hardware failure or as-of-yet-undiscovered design flaw. This is not a growth budget. Most projects continue, few are started, and some are cancelled or delayed. The Biden Administration was placed in a difficult position due to the spending limits imposed by Congress, but still made questionable choices that will exacerbate festering funding problems — particularly in its science directorate. Inflation further undermines NASA's upcoming agenda; even modest-seeming funding downturns are more painful as a consequence. Congress, though the ultimate source of NASA's budgetary problems due to the 2023 spending caps, can also be the solution. NASA's Science Mission Directorate budget must grow relative to inflation, not shrink, to both ensure the nation's continued leadership in space and the pursuit of transformative scientific discoveries, as well as maintain the cohesion and stability of its scientific and engineering workforce. In ideal circumstances, we'd want to see a Science Mission Directorate budget closer to $9 billion, a modest 4% increase over its inflation-adjusted peak in 2020. That would enable the pursuit of all top-priority science projects across the science portfolio, along with strong support for fundamental research and small- and medium-class missions in all divisions. That is an optimistic scenario given the spending limits already in law and the upcoming election season in the U.S., which will very soon come to dominate the political process and very likely delay any budgetary resolution until late 2024 or early 2025. The Planetary Society will engage with Congress in the coming year to address these budgetary shortfalls and to ensure direction and support for top-priority missions within a balanced NASA science directorate.

Title: Is the Moon shrinking?
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/is-the-moon-shrinking
Detailed Text:
Kate Howells•Mar 25, 2024
The Moon as we see it is always changing. Throughout the month, our planet’s natural satellite goes through phases as its orientation relative to Earth and the Sun changes. The phases are predictable and cyclical, givingthe Moona constancy in spite of its variability. But the Moon is also changing in other, more permanent ways. The Moon is shrinking. Both its actual volume and its apparent size from Earth’s perspective are getting smaller. Although both of these phenomena are happening extremely slowly, they are actually measurable. The change in the Moon’s actual size is caused by the cooling of its interior. The Moon wasformed from a great collisionbetween early Earth and another protoplanet about 4.5 billion years ago. This collision created an enormous amount of heat, and the Moon has been cooling off ever since. Although its exterior today is cold and solid, the Moon’s interior is still cooling down, causing it to contract. This contraction affects the entire Moon, causing its surface area to decrease and itssolid crust to wrinkle.
We know this is happening in large part because of imagery and data from spacecraft like NASA’sLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. This mission, which has been in orbit around the Moon since 2009, and past missions have captured images showing a particular kind of cliff on the lunar surface. Known as fault scarps, these cliffs are caused by two parts of the Moon’s crust being pushed together and forced upward. Fault scarps arefound across the lunar surface, giving strong evidence of ongoing contraction deep inside its interior. Estimates suggestthe Moon has become about 50 meters (150 feet) smaller in diameter over the last several hundred million years. And the Moon doesn’t appear to have stopped shrinking yet. The Moon’s active shrinking is thought to cause seismic activity known as “moonquakes.” We have had evidence of moonquakes ever since theApollo program, when astronauts placed seismometers on the lunar surface. These instruments recorded 28 moonquakes between 1969 and 1977 ranging from about 2 to around 5 on the Richter scale.
Other evidence comes from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter images that showboulders at the bottom fault scarfs. Weathering from solar radiation gradually darkens material on the lunar surface, and because these boulders are surrounded by brighter material it suggests that these regions were recently exposed to space, as expected if a recent moonquake had sent material sliding down the cliff. The shrinking Moon doesn’t cause any effects on Earth. Although it’s contracting, the Moon’s mass isn’t changing. This means that lunar effects on Earth’s rotation and tides won’t change due to its size reduction. As well as shrinking in volume and surface area, the Moon is also shrinking in apparent size from Earth’s perspective as it gradually moves farther away from our planet. The Moon moves about 4 centimeters (1.5 inches)farther away from usevery year. This slow but steady distancing is primarily caused by the two-way gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon. Most people are familiar with the Moon’s gravitational effects on Earth, which cause tides. But you may not know that these tides in turn pull back on the Moon. Tides are essentially bulges on Earth, both in water and on land. There are always two bulges on Earth: one on the side facing the Moon and one on the opposite side. These bulges move around the planet along with the Moon. But because Earth is also rotating at a faster rate than the Moon’s orbit around it, the bulge closer to the Moon is always pulling slightly ahead of the Moon, tugging it along in the process. This slight pull from the passing bulge causes a very gradual increase in the Moon’s orbital speed. As the Moon speeds up it moves to a higher orbit, farther away from the Earth, which in turn slows it down.
The first evidence we got of the Moon’s changing distance also came from the Apollo missions. Astronauts placedretroreflectors on the Moon's surfaceso that scientists could bounce laser beams off the Moon and back to Earth, accurately measuring its distance and changes in that distance over time. You won’t notice any changes in your lifetime, but the Moon’s gradual movement away from Earth will have effects over longer periods of time. Total solar eclipses, which rely on the astonishingly perfect coincidence of the Sun and Moon’s apparent size from Earth being the same, will not last forever. In about 620 million years, total solar eclipses will become less frequent, only occurring when the Moon is at its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit.The very last total solar eclipsewill happen about 1.2 billion years from now. The Moon’s changing distance also has an intangible but steady effect on the length of a day on Earth. As the Earth tugs on the Moon to speed it up, our planet loses some of its rotational energy. This causes the Earth's rotation to slow down very slightly. As a result, an Earth day gets a little bit longer all the time. This change is tiny, only adding a millisecond to Earth’s day every 50 years.

Detailed Text:
Casey Dreier•Mar 20, 2024
Five months into the fiscal year under consideration, Congress finally passed a budget for NASA on March 8, 2024. It provided $24.9 billion, a cut of 2% (about half a billion dollars) relative to 2023. This is NASA’s first year-over-year cut since 2013, a direct result of congressionally mandated spending capspassed in the summer of 2023. As a result, funding for most NASA programs remained flat relative to 2023. The notable exception wasArtemis, which saw a slight budget increase of $200 million to $7.7 billion. NASA’s return-to-the-Moon effort again demonstrated the resilience of its political coalition by continuing to grow despite this year’s budgetary pressure. Funding for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, on the other hand, shrank by $457 million. This cut was directed at a single project the Planetary Science Division’stroubledMars Sample Return(MSR) project. Originally requested at $949 million, Congress provided “no less” than $300 million, but removed $522 million from the Planetary Science Division's total budget. If NASA wants to provide additional funds to MSR in FY 2024, money would have to come from other projects. Whether this will occur is uncertain given the negative politics of such a decision and the program’s current development freeze during its extended reformulation/replanning process. Regardless, it’s not too much to say that MSR took it on the chin in FY 2024 to preserve the space agency’s other science initiatives. Despite these difficulties, many of The Planetary Society’s top advocacy and policy goals ended up fully or partially included in the final congressional budget.
The Planetary Society’s annual advocacy and policy goals derive from ourfoundational principlesof scientific exploration, the search for life, and planetary defense. At the start of every year, we look for space science and exploration projects that closely adhere to these priorities, are facing immediate budgetary threats, and currently lack broad political support. We seek to optimize our members’ advocacy by directing their work to these high-impact, under-appreciated opportunities to advance scientific understanding and exploration of the cosmos.
The Planetary Society has been a stalwart supporter ofthis critical planetary defense missionfor many years, and it continued to be a priority for us in the FY 2024 budget. In the past year, NASA finally "confirmed" the mission with a 2028 launch date. The agency requested $209.7 million in FY 2024 to help meet this schedule. Happily, Congress provided the necessary funding despite a reduced budget for planetary science.
In early 2023 NASA announced that theVERITASmission to Venus was suspended with no timeline for a restart and no launch date. This was no fault of the mission, which had performed well up to that point. While this budget doesn’t specifically restore funding in FY 2024, it does include language directing NASA to submit a new budget profile and schedule for the mission and “encourages” the space agency to request sufficient funding to ensure a launch by the end of the decade. NASA’s subsequent budget request provided a new budget and schedule for VERITAS, though with a 2031 launch date — a huge turnaround for this valuable science mission.
Mars Sample Return emerged bruised and battered but alive in the FY 2024 budget, despite a Senate cancellation threat and an ongoing replanning process within NASA. The final budget provided "no less" than $300 million and "up to" the request of $949 million, though the overall budget within its home division, planetary science, decreased by nearly $500 million. Given its current status, it is unlikely the project could spend the upper amount this year. The budget agreement also explicitly rejects theSenate's original cancellation threatand restates that the project is the top priority of the planetary science community in the coming decade. In addition to these big three items, The Planetary Society had additional goals we supported via our Washington, D.C. presence last year. A number of these also made it into the final congressional budget, including: Over a hundred Planetary Society membersvisited Washington, D.C. in the fall of 2023to advocate for our priorities. Many thousands more wrote and called their representatives in Congress. These achievements are due to the collective effort of the members and supporters of The Planetary Society. We look forward to making the case to reverse these cuts and grow NASA inFY 2025.

The 2024 total solar eclipse is less than a month away. On April 8, the Moon will cross in front of the Sun, casting a shadow on our planet. Most of North America will see a partial eclipse, and for those in the path of totality — the deepest part of the Moon’s shadow —the sky will darken, treating viewers to a rare glimpse of the Sun’s corona. We highly recommendtraveling to the path of totality if you have the means, but if you can’t make it, you can still enjoy the wonders of a partial eclipse. Regardless of where you watch, there are hundreds of eclipse events being held all across North America. Many will have experts and solar telescopes on hand to broaden your enjoyment of the big day. We’ve put together a list of resources below to help you find an eclipse event in your area. Check out oureclipse headquarters pageto learn more about the eclipse, including ourEclipse-O-Rama event in Fredericksburg, Texas.
One of the most comprehensive resources for finding events in the path of totality comes fromThe Eclipse Company, which has partnered with The Planetary Society. The Eclipse Company’swebsiteandappallow you to select a state or province in the path of totality and see a list of communities hosting events. The website version includes a map that highlights communities with events, as well as links to event websites. Right now the app includes over 700 events, making it one of the best resources for planning your day in the path of totality. The AAS is an international organization of professional astronomers, amateur astronomers, and astronomy educators. Their eclipse pages have links to events being held inmajor cities along the path of totality, and a longer list of events sorted bystates and provinces. The AAS also has a comprehensiveeclipse resource sectionthat covers everything from eye safety to how to take pictures of the eclipse. NASA has alist of eclipse eventsthat are NASA hosted or affiliated, or will have a NASA expert present. Make sure to filter the list so that you’re only seeing events related to the 2024 eclipse. Not all events are in the path of totality. If you can’t see the eclipse for yourself, you can tune in to NASA’slive stream, which will feature experts answering audience questions and telescopic views from locations along the path of totality. NASA also has a comprehensiveeclipse resource page. Check it out to find maps, viewing tips, FAQs, and more.
To avoid risking permanent eye damage, you need eye protection to watch a solar eclipse. The easiest way to ensure eye safety is using solar eclipse glasses. These should be special glasses that say “ISO 12312-2” on them and are made by a vendor approved by the American Astronomical Society. Otherwise, your glasses don’t meet international safety standards and aren’t fit for solar viewing. Check out our complete solar eclipse glasses guideto learn more. You can also purchaseThe Planetary Society’s solar eclipse glassesfrom AAS-approved vendor American Paper Optics.
The websitegreatamericaneclipse.comis run by a team of eclipse experts. It has detailed predictions for how many people will travel to each state. The bottom of eachstate pagehas links to events happening in local communities. TheEclipse Companylists events taking place in the path of totality in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. The CBC has a list ofCanadian eventstaking place in the path of totality. Space.com also highlights somegood placesto watch the eclipse in Canada. TheCanadian Space Agencyhas a resource page with some Canada-specific information. NASA’sevent listincludes two in-person events in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, and a telescope live stream from Torreon, Coahuila. Space.com has alist of promising locationsin Mexico to see the eclipse. If the above resources aren’t enough to find an eclipse event in your area, you may have to do your own research. The AAS recommends checking for eclipse events through science museums, planetariums, amateur astronomy clubs, colleges, and universities.

Title: Red Rover Goes to Mars, 20 years later
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/red-rover-goes-to-mars-20-years-later
Detailed Text:
Jason Davis•Mar 12, 2024
Twenty years ago, NASA’sOpportunity roverlanded on Mars. Its twin, Spirit, had reached the surface three weeks earlier. The two robotic field geologists would usher in a new era of Mars exploration and confirm liquid water once flowed on the planet’s surface. At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, an international group of high schoolers watched Opportunity’s dramatic descent alongside scientists and engineers working on the mission. The students were part of The Planetary Society’sRed Rover Goes to Mars program, a partnership with LEGO to engage and educate the public, and give students opportunities to participate in Mars missions. Among the “student astronauts,” as they were called, was Abigail Fraeman. After the celebration of a successful landing and a raucous press conference, she and other participants watched with the science team as the rover’sfirst imagesarrived, showing it had come to a rest inside a shallow crater. “Those images just hooked me completely, because they showed a picture of Mars that was unlike any other picture of Mars we'd ever seen,” said Fraeman recently. “It really showed me that Mars is a place we can explore, and there's so much we haven't seen.” The experience convinced Fraeman to pursue a career in space. In the time it took her to earn a Ph.D. in planetary science, Opportunity was still exploring Mars on what became a 14-year mission, even though the rover was only supposed to last 90 days. In a full-circle moment, Fraeman became the deputy project scientist for the Opportunity mission. Now, she is the deputy project scientist for the Curiosity mission. “It's not an exaggeration to say that this program literally changed my life,” she said of Red Rover Goes to Mars. Quotes in this article were drawn from an interview onPlanetary Radioandhave been edited for clarity and brevity.
The Red Rover Goes to Mars program encompassed more than student engagement. It included a contest to name the rovers, mini-DVDs that accompanied them to Mars, and a variety of other public outreach activities. “It took a lot of effort over many years for The Planetary Society to execute the whole program,” said Planetary Society Chief Scientist Bruce Betts, who managed the program in its later years. The Planetary Society and LEGO collected student essays for a contest to name the rovers that drew nearly 10,000 entries. A nine-year-old named Sofi Collinswrote the winning essay. "I used to live in an orphanage,” her entry read. “It was dark and cold and lonely. At night, I looked up at the sparkly sky and felt better. I dreamed I could fly there. In America, I can make all my dreams come true. Thank you for the 'Spirit' and the 'Opportunity.'"
The Society also provided the mission withtwo silica DVDscontaining the names of 4 million well-wishers collected by NASA. Each DVD was mounted to a rover’s landing platform with aluminum LEGO bricks and stamped with the image of a LEGO astronaut. The two astronauts, Biff Starling and Sandy Moondust,transmitted fictional diariesof their experiences back to Earth. Both Spirit and Opportunity imaged the DVDs after rolling off their landing platform. The DVDs hadsecret codesfor Earthlings to decipher.
The student participation portion of the program was more than just being at JPL when the rovers landed. In 2001, students went to Malin Space Systems in San Diego, California to operate the camera on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. In 2002, they went to JPL to operate a prototype rover namedFIDO, which was a scaled-down version of the Mars Exploration Rovers. Sixteen-year-old Courtney Dressing was at JPL when Spirit landed. As a child, she had wanted to be an astronaut. Now, as a member of the Red Rover Goes to Mars program, she was watching scientists prepare for what was destined to become a beloved, long-lasting Mars mission. “I remember looking at the map where Spirit was supposed to land,” she said. “As the scientists and engineers discussed where they thought the rover would end up, we also took notes about what we saw and we wrote blog entries to share with the world about our experiences.” Later, she helped calibrate images of thesundialon the rover and track dust accumulation as the mission progressed. The experience had a major impact on her career. She earned her undergraduate and graduate degrees in astrophysics, and her Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics. She is now an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in exoplanets. “I think it's fair to say that my career would not be what it has been without having been a Red Rover Goes to Mars student astronaut,” Dressing said. She currently co-leads the science team for NASA’s next large telescope, called theHabitable Worlds Observatory. HWO is often referred to as a “Super Hubble'' telescope. It will be designed to directly image 25 potentially habitable worlds, probing their atmospheres for signs of life.
Fraeman said part of the Red Rover program’s legacy is showing her the importance of inspiration and public outreach. “It definitely showed me the power of outreach, and that it can literally change somebody's life and set the course of their life,” she said. “It really instills in me how important it is to share what we're doing and the good that can come from that.” She advised students seeking their own careers in space exploration to follow their passions and find a path that works for them. “There are so many ways to be involved. There's the path that I took, which is studying science and getting a career as a scientist at NASA, but there are also career paths in communication, sharing, and teaching,” she said. Dressing agreed on the importance of science communication and the value of finding ways to get students involved early. “My experience as a student astronaut definitely caused me to think more closely about science communication,” she said. “I really appreciated the chance to be behind the scenes, and now that I'm in more of a leadership role, I want to be sure that we bring in students and amateurs from around the world to participate in these missions.” She is bringing that philosophy to her work on the next-generation telescope that could find signs of life on another world. “One of the things I'm most excited about for the Habitable Worlds Observatory is that we have a whole group that's devoted to mentorship and communication and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,” said Dressing. “We want to be sure that this really is everybody's mission.”

The Planetary Society is pleased to announce the C. Wallace Hooser Award for Visionary Philanthropy and its first recipient, Mark Gelfand. The award is named in memory of longtime board member and friend Wally Hooser, who believed that The Planetary Society represented a long-term investment in humanity. Wally felt that it was vital to explore the Cosmos and realize our place in space while also protecting our species from tangible threats, like hazardous asteroids and comets. A decade ago, Wally challenged the board and staff to build a more fiscally sustainable Planetary Society. He infused the organization with self-confidence that helped it grow into what it is today.As Wally was battling the illness that would eventually take him, we established the C. Wallace Hooser Award for Visionary Philanthropy in his name. Award candidates must have a track record of exceptional generosity and commitment to the promotion of space science, exploration, and education. They must demonstrate outstanding civic responsibility and encourage others to take philanthropic leadership roles. Finally, they must share their time, talent, and treasure in a manner consistent with the example set forth by Wally Hooser. Wally passed away in 2021. We miss him dearly, yet his legacy with The Planetary Society lives on thanks to his generosity, his kind spirit, and this new award to honor those who follow in his footsteps.
We are pleased to announce that Mark Gelfand is the first recipient of the C. Wallace Hooser Award for Visionary Philanthropy. Inspired by the space race of the 1960s, Mark has always been interested in technology and how things work. He received a degree in physics and went on to work in finance, awed by the mathematical similarities between thermodynamics and financial markets. Mark joined The Planetary Society in 1998. He has given generously to the organization over the years, supporting ambitious technology projects such as solar sailing and a mission to send microorganisms on a round-trip mission to the Martian moon Phobos. “The Planetary Society deals with things that are accessible, if not today, soon — within a decade or two,” he said. Mark is passionate about the power of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. He is the founder and president of STEMpower, an organization that has established more than 110 STEM centers across sub-Saharan Africa. The organization provides enrichment centers and hands-on labs that encourage pre-university students to pursue STEM careers. It’s challenging work, and Mark said that STEMpower’s track record of getting things done is similar to that of The Planetary Society. “We do what is practical and doable,” he said. “We don’t dream of things; we do things.” With his trademark humility, Mark said that he was honored to receive the award and noted that much of the credit goes to his STEMpower staff. “It’s all a wonderful honor. I’m glad people are realizing that they see some value in this and what we’re doing,” he said. The Planetary Society sees great value in how Mark is changing the world, and we’re pleased to bestow this honor. Wally would be proud.
Planetary Society members rallied together to support several important campaigns in late 2023. Last autumn, members raised over $80,000 for the LightSail program’s ongoing work. These funds will allow The Planetary Society to broaden the possibilities of solar sailing by sharing the remarkable story of LightSail with scientists, engineers, and space enthusiasts around the world. This includes publishing a book about the program; disseminating our findings in scientific journals and at conferences; and building a master archive of all the mission data to share with engineers, scientists, and future missions. And in our annual year-end fundraising drive, members came together to raise over $200,000, unlocking an additional $20,000 in matching funds from generous members of our board of directors on #GivingTuesday. Plus, we unlocked $100,000 in additional matching funds thanks to a generous Society member. These funds will help us continue all of our work through 2024 and beyond. Thank you for your support!
Following a two-year hiatus,
the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus has officially been
rechartered in the 118th Congress thanks to the leadership of the caucus
co-chairs: Reps. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska) and Judy Chu (D-California).
This bipartisan effort will offer a venue for members of Congress to
rally in support of space science, research, and exploration. The
Congressional Planetary Science Caucus was originally founded in 2018
and existed through the end of the 116th Congress (January 2021). The
Planetary Society worked closely with Reps. Bacon and Chu to reorganize
the caucus for the 118th Congress. According to the caucus’s official
charter, its goals are to: Thanks to strong financial support from our members and
thousands of small donors, the Society’s Space Policy & Advocacy
program has grown in size and capability over the past few years. We
used this expanded in-house expertise to work closely with a bipartisan
group of lawmakers to assist them in putting together the caucus, and we
will provide ongoing support and outreach to the public and the
scientific community.
One of the winning projects from the 2023 round of STEP (Science and Technology Empowered by the Public) Grants is a multiyear study of salty lakes on Earth that share characteristics with the past and present oceans of other planets and moons. Dr. Jacob Buffo of Dartmouth College, who is leading the project, gave us an update on the first field trip his team took to British Columbia’s Cariboo Plateau in Canada to study small, extremely salty lakes there. This trip was made possible thanks to the support of The Planetary Society’s member-funded STEP Grants. “One of the highlights of the trip was getting to work with such a multidisciplinary group of scientists up there,” said Buffo, “and for them to get to meet each other and try to figure out all the puzzling aspects of these lake systems together.” Buffo’s team is very diverse, including specializations in remote sensing, geochemistry, astrobiology, planetary analog systems, biogeochemistry, geobiology, planetary science, and geophysics. Another exciting outcome of the trip was gaining experience collaborating with drone operators from the University of New Hampshire who were doing complementary work gathering hyperspectral drone imagery of the lake sites. Buffo’s team will now match what they see in the aerial drone data with the biochemical and geochemical data they’re collecting on the ground. This could test strategies for using planetary exploration drones, like Ingenuity, to scope out landscapes on other worlds to select targets for astrobiological study by rovers or even human explorers. “These lakes continue to surprise us each time we go up there,” said Buffo. The STEP Grant funds will support several more field trips for Buffo and his team, helping to advance this exciting field of planetary analog research.

Title: Seizing upon syzygy

In terms of sheer cosmic spectacle, it’s hard to beat a total solar eclipse. Watching the Moon blot out the Sun for a few minutes can be a life-changing experience that prompts you to consider your place in space. For scientists, it’s also a unique opportunity to study the Sun and its effect on our planet. Past eclipses have enabled us to prove Einstein’s theory of general relativity, discover the element helium, uncover sun-grazing comets, and more. During the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse, the Moon’s shadow will cross Mexico, the United States, and Canada. More than 43 million people live within the path of totality, and countless more will travel to see it, including scientists who hope to make the most of the moment. We spoke with three solar scientists to learn about their plans for the big event. A lunar coronagraph While telescopes and spacecraft can use coronagraphs to block the Sun and reveal the corona, nothing beats the Moon, said Kevin Reardon, a scientist and astronomer at the National Solar Observatory in Boulder, Colorado. “The Moon remains the best coronagraph because it’s so far away and it’s exactly the right size,” he said. “It blocks the Sun’s light even before it gets to Earth’s atmosphere, making the background very dark. That allows us to see the corona both very close to the Sun and for an extended distance away and make some specific measurements that are only possible during an eclipse.”
Reardon and his colleagues are traveling to Mazatlán, Mexico, for the 2024 eclipse, where the sky will darken for almost four-and-a-half minutes, and chances of clear skies are very high. There, they will set up telescopes equipped with spectrographs that split light into its component wavelengths. During totality, they will measure the smearing of the solar spectrum caused by the Sun’s light scattering off fast-moving electrons in the corona. This process is related to the Doppler effect — the same phenomenon that makes an ambulance’s siren change in pitch as it passes by. By connecting the amount of smearing to the velocities of the electrons, they can in turn determine the temperatures in the corona. A longstanding solar science puzzle is why the Sun’s corona is hotter than the surface just a few thousand kilometers below. These temperature measurements will be another step toward solving the mystery. Reardon said that testing and preparing his equipment to make sure everything works properly can be stressful, but he hopes to have time to steal a glance at the eclipse for himself. “If all goes well, you can press the button and the equipment will run for part or most of the eclipse by itself, acquiring the data,” he said. “There’s always time to look up and take in the whole spectacle.” Chasing the shadow While a solar eclipse is a great opportunity for scientists to study the Sun’s corona, ground-based observers still have to peer through Earth’s atmosphere to make their measurements. Certain studies are difficult or impossible, like observing the Sun in infrared light, since our atmosphere glows at infrared wavelengths. Fortunately, there’s a solution: fly high-altitude research planes above most of the atmosphere to get a clearer view.
During the 2017 eclipse, Amir Caspi, a principal scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, led a team that equipped two of NASA’s WB-57 planes with infrared cameras. The two-seater planes, bearing a pilot and an instrument specialist, flew along the path of totality, chasing the eclipse to give them a few extra minutes in the Moon’s shadow. The result was the highest-resolution image ever captured of the Sun’s corona in medium-wave infrared light. In the image, a solar prominence, a strand of hot gas looping off the Sun’s surface, and an “active region,” a large concentration of magnetic fields from which solar flares often emerge, showed up at the same intensity of infrared light. This was surprising because active regions are much hotter than prominences. “The intensity in the active region is about the same as the intensity in the prominence, even though they are two orders of magnitude different in temperature,” said Caspi. “So why is that? What is driving the infrared emission for these? That’s what we’re hoping to find out in 2024.”
For the 2024 eclipse, Caspi’s team will once again use a NASA WB-57 that will fly along the eclipse path near Mazatlán, giving them a couple extra minutes in the Moon’s shadow. The plane will be outfitted with a small telescope that feeds four science instruments that will image the Sun’s corona in three different types of infrared light as well as ultraviolet and visible light. The results may help them determine what is driving the infrared emission in prominences and the corona. They may also learn how much different wavelengths of light coming from prominences and the corona are reflected from the Sun’s surface versus being generated on their own. The power to educate A third solar scientist sees the eclipse as a calling to educate and inspire the public. Maria Kazachenko was a high school student in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1999. She joined a group of students and teachers for a multiday bus ride across Europe to reach the path of totality for a total solar eclipse crossing Hungary. The experience made a huge impact on her life.
“This experience was so amazing that basically, it was a turning point in my life when I decided to become an astronomer,” she said. Kazachenko later specialized in solar science. She is now an assistant professor at the Astrophysical & Planetary Science Department at the University of Colorado, Boulder and the National Solar Observatory. For the 2023 annular eclipse, she traveled to Texas with colleagues for two days of eclipse outreach at local schools and public venues. Her team explained how the Sun works using hands-on experiments and hosted a viewing party for the moment of annularity, where the Moon, slightly too far away from Earth to fully block the Sun, crossed within the Sun’s disk to create a perfect “ring of fire.” While in her day job as a professor Kazachenko studies solar flares, she has no science scheduled for the 2024 eclipse — instead, she’ll be back in Texas working with the public. “I feel that going to eclipses and using it as an outreach opportunity is a way for me to give back to the community,” she said. “The experience itself is so amazing that especially if you’re on the path, you cannot miss it.”

Title: An exquisite cosmic coincidence

Detailed Text:
From Our Member Magazine
Total solar eclipses are easy to appreciate. For as long as our historical records go back, we know that humans have marveled at them. Many cultures developed mythological explanations for eclipses, believing that only gods could blot out the Sun. Some ancient cultures developed sophisticated astronomical systems that could explain and actually predict eclipses. Today, we understand the motions of celestial objects so well that we can predict the exact minute a solar eclipse will begin at any given location. But the depth of our understanding of the Cosmos doesn’t lessen our appreciation of eclipses. In many ways, it enhances it. Although syzygy (the alignment of celestial objects, like Earth, the Sun, and the Moon) is a completely normal thing in the Solar System, the way it creates eclipses on Earth is unique. This has to do with a wonderful coincidence of size and distance. The Sun is 400 times larger in diameter than the Moon, and the Sun also happens to be 400 times farther away from Earth than the Moon (most of the time — more on that later). This makes it so that both objects appear to be the same size from the perspective of Earth (in most locations — more on that later too). When syzygy occurs, the Moon can perfectly cover the Sun’s face.
Although other planets with moons experience syzygy with the Sun, none also have this coincidence of apparent size. On Mars, for example, syzygy between the planet, its largest moon (Phobos), and the Sun produces a transit, not an eclipse; Phobos is very small, so it just passes in front of the Sun without obscuring it completely. From the vantage point of the outer planets, like Jupiter or Neptune, the Sun is so distant that syzygy with any large moons would more than obscure the Sun. Only on Earth do we get the perfect eclipse that lets us look at the Sun’s corona (the wispy tendrils of its outer atmosphere) and even see prominences (loops of plasma extending from its surface) while its bright light is blocked by the Moon.
Annular eclipses demonstrate just how perfect the size-distance ratio has to be to produce a total solar eclipse. The Moon’s orbit around Earth is elliptical, meaning it comes closer to Earth at certain points in this orbit and farther at others. The difference between the two extremes is about 40,000 kilometers (about 25,000 miles), which creates a change of about 14% in the Moon’s apparent size from Earth. When syzygy coincides with apogee (the point in the Moon’s orbit when it’s farthest from Earth), the Moon doesn’t completely cover the Sun. Instead, a ring of sunlight remains visible around the edges, which is why an annular eclipse is often referred to as a “ring of fire” eclipse. Locations closer to the poles, such as the Arctic and Antarctic regions, see annular eclipses more often than locations closer to the equator because the Moon is slightly farther away from Earth’s poles than from its equatorial regions, making its apparent size in the sky slightly smaller.
Even 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) away from the Sun, these small changes in location and lunar distance are enough to make a big difference. In locations experiencing an annular solar eclipse, enough sunlight reaches Earth that people might not even realize that an eclipse is happening unless they have solar eclipse glasses to look at the Sun and see the “ring of fire.” Learning about how rare and coincidental our planet’s experience of solar eclipses is when compared to other worlds really drives home just how special this celestial phenomenon is. If you get a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in your lifetime, let this be another layer to your enjoyment of the experience.

Title: The science value of Mars Sample Return
Link: https://www.planetary.org/articles/the-science-value-of-mars-sample-return
Detailed Text:
The Planetary Society•Mar 05, 2024
Humanity is poised to take a giant leap forward in what we know about Mars, Earth, and the prospect of life on another planet. Mars Sample Returnis a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency to collect samples of rock, soil, and atmospheric gases from Mars and bring them to Earth. The project is already underway. Right now, NASA’sPerseverancerover is collecting samples in Jezero Crater, where a river once spilled into an ancient lake. The rover has already filledmore than halfof the small sample tubes it brought to Mars with lake sediments and water-altered lavas. Getting the samples back to Earth will require two additional missions. A Mars lander will collect the samples and launch them into orbit, where another spacecraft will collect them and ship them back to Earth. The ambitious plan is the outcome of years of community effort inestablishing the science case for Mars Sample Returnand determining the right samples to bring back. Mars Sample Return has been the top priority of thepasttwodecadal surveys, which are produced every 10 years tooutline the prioritiesof the U.S. planetary science community. But Mars Sample Return is in danger. In 2023, an independent review found that the mission was growing in cost and significantly increasing in cost. In response, the U.S. Senatethreatenedto cancel MSR. Congress ultimately backed off from the cancellation threat,significantly reducing fundingwhile NASA replanned the project. The Planetary Society supportsreplanning according to a few key principles. MSR is worth doing; it is arguably the most ambitious scientific endeavor of our time — one that has the potential to transform our understanding of the Solar System and provide evidence of life beyond Earth. Here’s why Mars Sample Return is so important.
For all the wonders robotic space missions have to offer, they are limited by mass, power, and size requirements. We can’t carry all our large, precise laboratory equipment to space. That limits us when we want to precisely know a rock’s age, the conditions in which it formed, and whether it carries signatures of past life, said Jeffrey Johnson, a planetary geologist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. “Many Martian science objectives can only be achieved by analyzing returned samples in laboratories on Earth,” he said. “The sophisticated instruments at such facilities can detect subtle chemical, mineralogical, and morphological signatures with greater precision and accuracy than is possible with miniaturized robotic instruments on the Martian surface.” Whereas a single spacecraft instrument tends to be designed for one particular function, the samples we return from Mars can be subjected to the full range of current and future scientific tools available on Earth. “It’s not that we can’t miniaturize and flight-harden one instrument, it’s that we can’t do it for all the instruments and analyses that we’d be able to perform on these rocks once they’re returned to Earth,” said Amy Williams, an assistant professor in geological sciences at the University of Florida. Many important analytical tests performed on rock and soil samples require careful preparation using fluids or slicing at ultrafine, nanometer scales. That just can’t happen on Mars. Nor can we bring to Mars the full range of equipment found in a single geosciences department, let alone the scope of advanced laboratories around the Earth. With returned samples, multiple labs will work together to validate, verify, and confirm key findings — multiple lines of evidence for, and confidence in, important scientific discoveries. This level of certainty and reproducibility is critical for bombshell results such as a possible sign of past life.
Perseverance is exploring a delta in Jezero Crater, formed by rocks and sediment where a river once flowed into an ancient lake. Deltas are good at trapping and preserving signs of life but their rocks are too fragile to survive a trip as a Mars meteorite to Earth. The samplesalready storedin Perseverance’s belly contain materials such as carbonates, silica, phosphate, and perhaps even organics, which are known for storing signs of life and records of an area’s past environment. All we have to do is get them back to Earth. “We are now on the cusp of obtaining samples that might be able to answer the fundamental question of whether we are alone in the universe,” Williams said. “We will be able to interrogate these samples with the finest cutting-edge modern techniques to search for evidence of ancient life.”
Right now, our best age data on Mars rocks comes from Martian meteorites that found their way to Earth after being blasted off the Red Planet by an impact. Unfortunately, we don’t know where these rocks originated on Mars, and the rocks themselves have been severely altered by the impact and millions of years of interplanetary transit. The carefully selected and protected samples we return from Mars will allow scientists to pin down precise ages and a detailed history for specific locations on the planet; in the case of Jezero Crater, a watery location. “This information is critical to constraining when water flowed on Mars and whether it was at a comparable time to the origin of life on Earth,” said Williams. High-resolution studies of the samples will help us piece together the history of Jezero Crater and learn about the processes that were happening on its surface long ago, including the massive changes in Mars’ climate that ultimately changed an “ocean world” into the dry desert planet it is today. “In particular, such measurements would give us a more precise idea of the compositions and temperatures of the fluids that interacted with the rocks,” Johnson said. “That will teach us about the conditions and durations under which alteration minerals such as clays and salts formed.”
Life arose on Earth about 3.5 billion years ago. Weather and geologic activity have reshaped and erased most of the rock evidence from that era, but on Mars, rocks that old are readily available. By studying them, we’ll learn what conditions were like in the Solar System when life arose on Earth. Was the surface continually bombarded by huge impacts or mostly quiet? How active was the sun with solar flares? How strong was the planetary magnetic field shielding Mars and when did it turn off? “These samples have the potential to fundamentally change our understanding of the Solar System, the formation and evolution of the inner rocky planets, how other Solar Systems and extrasolar planets form and evolve, and even our perception of our place in the Universe,” Williams said. Knowing the precise age of Mars rocks in a specific location will also allow us to update crater-counting models calibrated so far only on the Moon — but that are used to estimate the surface ages of all other worlds. Adding age data from Martian samples will help usrefine and improve our knowledgeof the timing of major events in Solar System history across all planets.
Unlike Mars rocks studied by a space mission with a finite lifespan, samples returned to Earth can be preserved for the new generations of scientists. In the future, we will have new questions that the samples can answer and new technologies to study them in ways we can’t fathom today. “As future laboratory instruments are developed, the samples will represent ‘the gift that keeps on giving,’” said Johnson. As an example, scientists initially concluded that rocks brought back from the Moon by Apollo astronauts were devoid of water. However,studies since thenhave found signs of water in Moon rocks, while orbiting spacecraft have detected water ice in permanently shadowed craters near the south pole. Mars Sample Return is expensive and challenging, but the science it delivers will be worth it. The investments we make in the program today will pay dividends to the explorers of tomorrow. “These are the next generation that will enter into science, math, and engineering careers to explore extrasolar planets, put boots on the ground on Mars, and maybe even discover extant life on another world,” said Williams. “We are on the cusp of a scientific revolution for ourselves and our posterity with the return of these samples from Mars.”

Amid thecost growth,political division, andmanagement misstepsroiling NASA and ESA’s Mars Sample Return program, it is not unreasonable to ask if there are more affordable alternatives to return these samples to Earth, namely SpaceX’s own Mars project, Starship. The answer is almost certainly “no.”  At least, not anytime soon. This is due to the unique needs of a scientifically relevant Mars sample return campaign, the uncertain capabilities of Starship, and the one-of-a-kind nature of the samples themselves. Mars Sample Return, as envisioned by NASA and ESA, is amulti-mission campaign. The samples are collected and stored by the Perseverance rover. Years later, a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lands nearby, into which the samples are loaded. The MAV launches the samples into Mars orbit, where they are collected by an orbiting spacecraft provided by the European Space Agency. That orbiter returns to Earth and drops the protected samples into Earth’s atmosphere, where they land in a deserted area to be collected and analyzed. SpaceX’s Starship and Super Heavy rocket, now making tremendous progress in Boca Chica, could, theoretically, complete a sample return project in a single mission, with far more mass,  for less money. It is designed to be reliable and rapidly reusable, and it can also be fueled using natural resources processed on Mars. NASA has already committed nearly $3 billion to Starship to serve as its lunar lander for Artemis, a smart move since it nets the agency atwo-for-one long-term investment in Moon and Mars hardware. But once specifics start coming into play, the uncertainties of Starship in active development become more pronounced, and a number of critical questions are revealed as unanswerable, making any reformulation of Mars Sample Return via Starship functionally impossible in a near-term timeline. These are some of the questions that need to be answered with confidence before Starship can be considered in a NASA-directed sample return campaign:


It’s likely that some of these questions may be answered in the next decade. But probably not all of them (or even most). Starship isrunning behind schedule for landing on the Moon; now likely to occur toward the end of the decade. SpaceX may ultimately establish Starship as a reliable and cost-effective access to the Martian surface. It’s just not clear when that will be and what caveats it will require. Tying this degree of schedule and hardware uncertainty to NASA’s highest near-term priority for planetary science is to relegate Mars Sample Return to a passive observer, reliant on a single private company to solve some of the most difficult engineering problems in human history. The Planetary Society’sprinciples for Mars Sample Returnare to prioritize the science return, to do it now, and to do it with balance within NASA’s larger portfolio. Until the questions outlined above have better answers, dependence on Starship challenges NASA’s ability to pursue the program now and to retain science as a priority. As convenient as it would be to have an external solution to MSR’s current programmatic problems, NASA remains responsible for its own destiny. The agency must forge its own path for sample return to ensure a successful and sustainable mission that addresses some of the biggest questions we have about our origins.
